"""Generate `research/DEAD-ENDS-merge.md` — the three-column crosswalk between the two
divergent versions of `research/DEAD-ENDS.md`.

Sources (never edited, only read):
  * `origin/holes:research/DEAD-ENDS.md`              -- orchestrator ledger, `[V]`/`[H]`, ~82 entries
  * `origin/research/adv-negative:research/DEAD-ENDS.md` -- PR #13, `[M]`/`[S]`/`[N]`, ~105 entries

Every entry on either side appears exactly once in the generated table; the script asserts
that.  The *action* column is a human judgement recorded in `CROSSWALK` below; the counts are
computed, not asserted.
