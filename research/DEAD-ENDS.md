# Dead ends

Consolidated negative results. **A route listed here must not be re-walked** until the stated
condition for reviving it is met.

Evidence grades: **[V]** verified by reading the cited source in this repo or by a check that was
actually run; **[H]** hearsay — paraphrased by a prior agent and never independently verified.

Format: one block per entry. `found-by` / `round` / `revive-when` are mandatory.

---

## A-1. The `oneBit*` fan-face recursors prove the wrong statement **[V]**

- **found-by:** `arch-fanfill` · **round 1** · **revive-when:** a recursor ranking **ambient** faces
  exists with a genuinely rank-decreasing Case 1.1 → 1.2 edge.
- **What was tried:** drive Craciun v3 §7.4.3 Case 1.1 → Case 1.2 through the existing
  `oneBitFanFaceDependency` / `OneBitFanFaceSeamDependency` / `finiteOverlapDependency`
  recursors in `CRNT/Geometry/FanRefinement.lean`.
- **Why it fails:** all three rank their tasks by the `coneSpanRank` of the **projected** (`Fin n`)
  fan cell plus a strip/endpoint bit. Craciun's Case 1.1 → 1.2 edge joins two **ambient**
  (`n+1`)-dimensional faces with the *same* `π_n`-image. In that order the edge has rank change 0,
  exactly the zero-decrease case flagged in the comment at
  `hyperplaneArrangementCommonFace_rank_decrease` (`FanRefinement.lean:2221`).
- **Why this is dangerous:** a proof built on these recursors elaborates, looks right, and proves a
  different theorem. It will not fail loudly.
- **Evidence:** the ranking fields of the three recursors versus the projection-equality edge
  required by Craciun Remark 7.6 (`f-nbhd(σ₀) = ⋃{T_n : basepoint(T_n) ∈ σ}`).

## A-2. `binaryWordValue` is the wrong termination measure **[V]**

- **found-by:** `arch-fanfill` · **round 1** · **revive-when:** a well-founded word order that
  *decreases* along the recursion edge is defined.
- **Why it fails:** it is **anti-monotone**. Later letters carry larger weights, so
  `value (α ++ [true]) = value (α ++ [false]) + 1` — the recursion runs *upward*. Craciun's footnote
  81 says ε(α) "grows exactly in the opposite direction than the standard ordering of the binary
  numbers", confirming the Lean encoding uses the wrong order.
- **Site:** `CRNT/Geometry/ZeroSeparatingInduction.lean:2337`.

## A-3. §7.3 is **not** open — do not re-attack **[V]**

- **found-by:** `arch-fanfill` · **round 1** · **revive-when:** never.
- **Status:** closed **for a single chain**. `CoordinateProjectedFaceChain.preBlueprintNeighborhood`
  (`ZeroSeparatingInduction.lean:1831`) is a `def` well-founded by `termination_by k => k`, with
  `face_subset_preBlueprintNeighborhood` (:1845), `preBlueprintNeighborhood_projected`
  (:1882 — the §7.3 projection-compatibility equation verbatim) and
  `isCompact_preBlueprintNeighborhood` (:1905) all proved.
- **What actually remains:** the *joint finite-face-lattice* version with Step 2 subdivision.

## A-4. The ε̃ scale system (Craciun eq. 19) is **not** open — do not re-attack **[V]**

- **found-by:** `arch-fanfill` · **round 1** · **revive-when:** never.
- **Status:** proved five times over in `CRNT/Geometry/ZeroSeparatingInduction.lean`:
  `exists_binaryWordTileScale_separation_on_chain` (:2741),
  `exists_uniform_binaryWordTileScale_separation_on_chains` (:2784),
  `exists_binaryWordTileScale_separation_on_allOnes` (:2831),
  `exists_uniform_coherentBinaryWordTileScale_full_chain_separation` (:2866),
  `exists_uniform_coherentBinaryWordTileScale_separation` (:3061).
- **Consequence:** any route needing coherent scales *on one chain* already has them.

## A-5. `Refines` is set-containment, not face-to-face equality **[V]**

- **found-by:** `arch-fanfill` · **round 1** · **revive-when:** a refinement predicate carrying the
  projection equality as a field exists.
- **Why it fails:** `Refines` (`FanRefinement.lean:94`) is set containment, and that module's own
- **Evidence:** the definition at `FanRefinement.lean:94` is `⊆`, not equality; the module's own
  comment at :3675 says the raw image family "need not satisfy the fan intersection axioms itself".
  So `π_n(B^ff_n) = B^ff_{n-1}` cannot be extracted from it.

## A-6. ~~"IsCompletePointedPolyhedralFan does not exist"~~ — **RETRACTED, the entry was WRONG** **[V]**

- **found-by:** `arch-fanfill` · **round 1** · **RETRACTED in round 1; orchestrator verified against
  the tree.**
- **The claim was false.** `IsPolyhedralFan` **does exist**, at
  `CRNT/Geometry/ConeFace.lean:196`, as a structure over `Fan E` carrying exactly the three clauses
  the plan said were missing: `faces_mem` (closure under exposed faces), `inter_common` (pairwise
  intersections coincide with a common cone), `covers` (the cones cover the ambient space).
  `CRNT/Geometry/PolyhedralFan.lean` exists and is already imported by `ToricInclusion.lean`;
  `IsPolyhedralFan.negated` is proved at :242.
- **Where the real gap is, corrected:** not the *predicate* but the **witness**. Nothing constructs
  a `Fan E` satisfying `IsPolyhedralFan` from CRNT data. That is task P1 in
  `research/HOLEA-FRAMING.md`.
- **Lesson recorded.** This entry was an inference from `docs/gac-v3-face-fill-plan.md`, not a
  check against the tree — a prior document's claim relayed as fact. **Grep the tree before
  recording an absence.** The retraction is kept, not deleted: the history of the error is part of
  the record.
## A-11. `CraciunZSH.hinterior` is **not** the paper's hypothesis, and the difference is fatal **[V]**

- **found-by:** `arch-delta` · **round 1** · **revive-when:** never.
- The repo packages the hypothesis as `C ⊆ interior K_C`. Craciun's actual hypothesis is
  **`C ⊆ relint_Ω K_C`**. Deriving the packaged version from the paper's version is **false** for
  every cone lying in a symmetry hyperplane `x_i = x_j` — which is the normal case for the
  `x₁–x₃`-symmetric arrangement fan the paper assumes (its own footnote 127).
- **Action:** attempt the **relint-chamber variant**, not the interior variant. Add a
  `chamber : Set E` hypothesis with `C ⊆ chamber` and `chamber ⊆ K`, replace `C ⊆ interior K` by
  `∀ x ∈ C ∩ sphere 0 1, ∃ ρ > 0, ball x ρ x ⊆ K ∩ (affine span of chamber)`, and conclude
  `∃ M, ∀ x, infDist x C < δ → M < ‖x‖ → x ∈ K`. That is exactly Lemma 9.7's hypothesis and it
  unblocks every real application.

## A-12. Lemma 9.7 has **no** quantitative bound on normal straying **[V]**

- **found-by:** `arch-delta` · **round 1** · **revive-when:** never.
- `BRIEF-A.md` §A.5 item 3 asked for "how far a normal may stray". That premise was wrong: the
  lemma's normal-membership conclusion is **non-strict** (`n ∈ C`, a closed cone), and the only
  quantification is an existential threshold "ε̂ small enough", realised in the proof as
  `‖log P‖ ≥ max_C M_C`. **Any Lean statement putting a slack `ε(δ)` on the normal would be an
  unproved strengthening nobody has made.** Do not attempt it.

## A-13. The n-dimensional upgrade of Lemma 9.7 is **not in the paper** **[V]**

- **found-by:** `arch-delta` · **round 1** · **revive-when:** only by proving it from scratch.
- Lemma 9.5/9.7 are stated only for `ℝ³` / `(0,1)³`, yet §8 Step 2 invokes 9.7 in `n` dimensions.
  The upgrade is not written down in v3 and is not derivable from the printed statements.
  **Record it as an independent, unwritten generalization** rather than assuming it.

## A-14. The width-≥δ flatness claim needs a qualification the repo omits **[V]**

- **found-by:** `arch-delta` · **round 1** · **revive-when:** never as stated.
- As written in `HANDOFF_gac_hole.md` §4 and the `HighCodimensionSiphonFace.lean` header, the
  argument fails at vertices (dimension 0) and on 1-dimensional pieces, where the cone has empty
  interior. The **polyhedrality conclusion survives** via the weaker dimension-free and δ-free
  statement; the intermediate claim does not hold everywhere.

## A-15. Craciun v3 §7/§9 is reachable only via alphaxiv **[V]**

- **found-by:** `arch-delta` · **round 1** · **revive-when:** never.
- `arxiv.org/html/1501.02860v3` silently truncates at §6.1.2 with **no error**; `#S9` anchors return
  the same truncated prefix. `arxiv.org/e-print/…` returns an archive listing, not the `.tex` body.
  ar5iv times out. The working route is `https://www.alphaxiv.org/abs/1501.02860v3`; the PDF is
  complete. **A researcher who fetches the HTML concludes §7–§9 do not exist.**

## B-11. The `TrueSREarCase2.lean` port cannot be a file copy **[V]**

- **found-by:** `arch-sr-case2` · **round 1** · **revive-when:** never.
- Line 1 of that file is `import CRNT.Multistationarity.TrueSREarCase1`, and
 **`TrueSREarCase1.lean` does not exist on `holes`**. The port must be re-authored from the import
  line up.
- Similarly `TrueSRCycle.even_of_signChange` appears nowhere in `CRNT/`; the base has only
  `private theorem N.trueSRCycle_even_of_signChange` (`TrueChemistrySRCriterion.lean:6885`). A
  public version must be proved.
- **Do not** let the ported file import `TrueChemistrySRCriterion` — it would drag `sorryAx` into
  the port's axiom footprint and couple it to the file we are trying to close. The branch file's
  comment at line 190 deliberately avoids this; **preserve that isolation**.

## B-12. The ear route must terminate in `hSR.2`, not in `hnd` **[V]**

- **found-by:** `arch-sr-case2` · **round 1** · **revive-when:** never.
- By B-1, every cycle-species-to-cycle-reaction SR edge is itself a cycle edge, so an ear glued to
  `C` reintroduces cycle edges at its endpoints and `hnd` can never hold. The ear must close via
  `hSR.2` using `lemmaA6_case2_*` / `sToRIntersectionOfTwoPaths`.

## A-7. The Anderson–Shiu route is correctly cited and must not be "corrected" **[V]**

- **found-by:** `papers-sf` · **round 1** · **revive-when:** never.
- Correct source: D. F. Anderson, *The dynamics of weakly reversible population processes near
  facets*, SIAM J. Appl. Math. **70** (2010) 1840–1858, **arXiv:0903.0901**. Theorem 3.2 is the
  near-facet estimate closing hole A's codimension-1 case.
- `CRNT/Dynamics/FacetRepulsionAndersonShiu.lean:22-24` already cites it correctly.
- **arXiv:2006.02483 is a dengue epidemiology paper and is not the source.** An early swarm brief
  asserted it was; that assertion was wrong and is recorded rather than deleted.

## A-8. CNP does not contain the entry-loss function or the entry-time matrix **[V]**

- **found-by:** `papers-sf` · **round 1** · **revive-when:** never.

## A-9. Craciun v3 is **arXiv:1501.02860**, not 2306.03055 **[V]**

- **found-by:** `papers-craciun` · **round 1** · **revive-when:** never.
- arXiv:2306.03055 is "Analyzing Syntactic Generalization Capacity of Pre-trained Language Models
  on Japanese Honorific Conversion" (Sekizawa & Yanaka, cs.CL). The correct paper is
  **arXiv:1501.02860**, G. Craciun, *Toric Differential Inclusions and a Proof of the Global
  Attractor Conjecture*, v3.
- The repository's own notes were right (`docs/persistence-gac.md:283`, `:300`); the swarm brief
  was wrong.

## A-10. The arXiv HTML of Craciun v3 is truncated — do not use it **[V]**

- **found-by:** `papers-craciun` · **round 1** · **revive-when:** never.
- `arxiv.org/html/1501.02860v3` ends mid-sentence in §6.1.1 and contains **no §7, §8 or §9**.
- Those are exactly the sections hole A needs. **A researcher who consults the HTML will
  silently conclude §7–§9 do not exist.** Use `arxiv.org/pdf/1501.02860v3` (91 pages, complete).
- Additionally: figures 1–15 are not machine-extractable and the constructions in §5, §6.1.1 and
  §6.2.1 are specified largely by figure reference, so their numeric blueprint data (specific ε
  values, red-dot placements, face enumerations) is **not recoverable from text**. Routes needing
  those numbers must reconstruct them or route through the textual §7.
- The LaTeX source tarball exists but the read tool cannot descend into the gzip; statements must
  be taken from the PDF.
- Craciun–Nazarov–Pantea (arXiv:1010.3050; **SIAM J. Appl. Math. 73 (2013), 305–329** — the year is
  2013, not 2010) contains no entry-loss function, no entry times, no entry-time matrix. Its
  mechanism is an invariant convex polygon orthogonal to normals of `conv(SC(N))`, in dimension
  ≤ 3. The entry-time machinery is D. F. Anderson, SIAM J. Appl. Math. **68** (2008), 1464–1476
  (full text not accessed; bibliographic fact only). `relEntropy` + tiers + Stiemke is Anderson
  arXiv:1101.0761.
- **Consequence:** the `wmax`/`Pmax` package in `HighCodimensionSiphonFace.lean` is **not** CNP's
  construction and must not be justified by citing CNP.

---

## B-1. The `hspan` witness for `no_spanning_path_of_trueSRCriterion` is **refuted** **[V]**

- **found-by:** `arch-sr-deg2` · **round 1** · **revive-when:** never, unless `hnd` is replaced by a
  satisfiable predicate.
- **What was tried:** supply the `hspan` witness (`∃ M, Q, hQ0, hQlast, hQnd`) that
  `no_spanning_path_of_trueSRCriterion` needs at `TrueChemistrySRCriterion.lean:8610`, the last step
  before the `sorry` at :8607.
- **Why it fails — a refutation, not a gap:** by `containsEdge_iff_cycleNeighbour`
  (`CRNT/Multistationarity/TrueSRCPairThirdEdge.lean:186`) together with
  `no_single_edge_chord_of_trueSRCriterion`
  (`CRNT/Multistationarity/TrueSRChordExtraction.lean:42`), **every** SR edge joining a cycle species
  to a cycle reaction is a cycle edge. Hence `hnd` at :8610 fails at `p = M−1` for **every**
  candidate `Q`.
- **This is the headline finding of round 1:** the Hole B residue is not merely unproved — the
  hypothesis it needs is unsatisfiable given the lemmas already proved above it.

## B-2. Degree splitting at the residue is degenerate **[V]**

- **found-by:** `arch-sr-deg2` · **round 1** · **revive-when:** never.
- **deg 0 / deg 1:** impossible — `TrueSRDegreeTwoNoSToR.left_right_species_ne` /
  `left_not_sameIncidence_right`.
- **deg 2:** vacuous — `hQ0late` forces `Q0.vertex 1` to be an off-cycle reaction.
- **deg 3a** (extra edge to a cycle reaction): empty, by B-1.
- **deg 3b:** the only surviving case, and `hSR` is silent about it.

## B-3. `hrest` cannot be discharged at the residue **[V]**

- **found-by:** `arch-sr-deg2` · **round 1** · **revive-when:** the upstream case analysis is
  restructured so that `hrest` dominates line 8607.
- **Evidence:** `hrest` is not in scope at line 8607 — it occurs only at lines 1652, 1699, 4327,
  4466, 4536, 4665, 7035, 7117. Its natural instance at the attachment species is refuted by
  `hattachment` itself. Already documented in the docstring of
  `no_degree_two_aggregate_causal_cycle_of_offCycle_hrest` (lines 7006–7018).

## B-4. `no_sToRIntersection_of_degree_two` is unusable as a closer **[V]**

- **found-by:** `arch-sr-deg2` · **round 1** · **revive-when:** never.
- Its hypothesis makes the second conjunct of `TrueSRStrongCriterion` vacuous — it removes the very
  tool the residue relies on.

## B-5. `hopp` / `hcausal` / `¬hnc` are already sharp **[V]**

- **found-by:** `arch-sr-deg2` · **round 1** · **revive-when:** never.
- They determine the class flux at `C.species b` for **all** `n` cycle reactions exactly — two
  nonzeros of opposite sign at the two neighbours, zero elsewhere, by
  `nonAdjacent_cycleClassFlux_eq_zero`. No slack remains to strengthen.

## B-6. The species-interior analogue does not apply **[V]**

- **found-by:** `arch-sr-deg2` · **round 1** · **revive-when:** never.
- Closing Case B via `no_reaction_species_ear_of_trueSRCriterion`
  (`TrueChemistrySRCriterion.lean:5735`) on `qC ⇝ … ⇝ q → s` fails because `s0` sits *strictly
  inside* every such path as an on-cycle species. That is precisely the S4/S5 obligation.

## B-7. `no_spanning_path_of_trueSRCriterion` cannot be applied to `Q0` **[V]**

- **found-by:** `arch-sr-case2` · **round 1** · **revive-when:** never.
- Blocked *provably*, not merely missing. Its hypothesis
  `hlast : C.HasVertex (Q.vertex ⟨M, _⟩)` is unsatisfiable: `hqm` puts `q` at position `m`, and
  `hQ0late` together with `hmpos : 0 < m` forces every index other than `0` off the cycle.
  `Q0` is **half-spanning**, never spanning.

## B-8. `hopp` does **not** force `k = 1` here **[V]**

- **found-by:** `arch-sr-case2` · **round 1** · **revive-when:** never.
- `hopp`, `hcausal` and `¬hnc` together constrain only **cycle** classes at cycle species. The
  first hop of `Q0` lands on an **off-cycle** class, because
  `TrueInternalAggregateCausalEdge` has no `inl → inl` case.
- The source comment's "k = 1 is forced by `hopp`" is therefore **only true for a path that stays
  on the cycle**, and `Q0` is not such a path. **The comment's stated reason is wrong.**

## B-9. **The residue's source comment is factually wrong about the tree** **[V]**

- **found-by:** `arch-sr-case2` · **round 1** · **revive-when:** the port lands.
- The comment at `TrueChemistrySRCriterion.lean:8600-8607` says the residue "awaits the A.6 Case-2
  source-block datum or `hrest` degree-two isolation". **Neither exists in `holes`.**
- The A.6 Case-2 machinery — `CRNT/Multistationarity/TrueSREarCase2.lean` — was written on
  `sr-fig8` / `backup-fig8` (commit `637a970`). That branch was **`reset: moving to ef8048c`** and
  **never merged into `holes`**. The comment describes a proof architecture that is not in this
  tree.
- **Do not search `holes` for the datum. It is not there. Port it.**

## B-10. There is no upstream case analysis to thread a datum from **[V]**

- **found-by:** `arch-sr-case2` · **round 1** · **revive-when:** never.
- `harr`, `hdecX`, `hdecY`, `CE`/`QE`/`PE`/`VE` appear **nowhere above** line 8607, and the whole
  proof constructs only **one** cycle plus **one** aggregate `RelPath`. A.6 Case-2 is not "one
  level up"; it is a different proof.

---

## The Hole B route that survives round 1

Every other route is refuted, so this one is forced and narrow. In order:

1. **Port** from branch `backup-fig8` (commit `637a970`,
   `CRNT/Multistationarity/TrueSREarCase2.lean`) exactly four items:
   `lemmaA6_case2_twoComponents`, `lemmaA6_case2_oneComponent`,
   `TrueSRCycle.SignDirected`, `TrueSRCycle.sToRIntersectionOfTwoPaths`.
   Add a new file and import it from `CRNT.lean`. **Do not cherry-pick the branch wholesale** —
   its remaining content depends on further unmerged side branches (`sr-blocks` `84e49f2`,
   `sr-route-ear` `9285de1`).
2. **Build** `exists_second_evenCycle_of_offCycle_escape` — the ear-extraction producer, which is
   the actual blocker. Start from `relPathToTrueSRSSPath`
   (`TrueChemistrySRCriterion.lean:5475`) to lift the species-to-species `RelPath` to a
   `TrueSRSSPath`, and use the in-tree `ss_three_glued_even_of_two` (:7976) for parity.
3. **Only then** edit lines 8601–8607 to close the ear with the in-scope `hattachment` and feed
   the resulting two even cycles to `lemmaA6_case2_*`. The 170-line positive branch at
   8376–8546 must keep elaborating untouched: do not move the `by_cases hv0r` at :8371, the
   `exfalso` at :8355, or the `hvr` split at :8301.

Step 2 is worth more than steps 1 and 3 combined. It is the single theorem Hole B waits on.

## Maintenance protocol

```
### <ID>. <one-line title> **[grade]**
- **found-by:** <agent> · **round** <n> · **revive-when:** <condition, or `never`>
- **Evidence:** <file:line, or the check that was actually run>
```

1. **Grade honestly.** `[V]` only if *you* read the cited source or ran the check this round. `[H]`
   for anything you are relaying. Never upgrade a grade you did not earn.
2. **One block per route.** Merge duplicates, keep both `found-by` attributions.
3. **Add on discovery, not at end of round.** A dead end found in hour 3 saves an hour-8 agent.
4. **Never delete an entry.** If a route is revived, add a new block referencing the old ID and
   explaining what changed.
5. **Do not add a 21st stale progress document.** This file is the index; long form goes in
   `research/routes/`.
## B-13. ~~A dedicated RR reaction-arc builder must be written from scratch~~ — **CORRECTED, IT IS NOT NEEDED** **[V]**

- **found-by:** `arch-sr-case2` · **round 1** · **correction to an earlier orchestrator claim.**
- I told the Hole B group that `arcFwd`/`arcBwd` exist only in the species flavour, so
  `exists_second_evenCycle_of_offCycle_escape` "cannot even be typed" without a new RR
  builder. **That was an over-read of a grep.** Building `reactionArc`/`reactionArcBwd` as
  `TrueSRPathRR` values from scratch, with hand-rolled index arithmetic and hand-proved `RRGluable`
  witnesses, would be a significant waste of round-2 budget.
- The RR arc is available as **`C.speciesArc … .toPath.prepend (…)`**, and the `RRGluable` witnesses
  follow from cycle-edge injectivity — the species arc is already proved (`TrueSRSpeciesPath.lean:902-990`).

## A-16. `exists_positive_omegaPoint_of_upperRegion` is a **dead target** **[V]**

- **found-by:** `papers-craciun` / `adv-audit.DriftA` · **round 1** · **revive-when:** never.
- Its two nominal unbuilt inputs are not equally hard. `hsplit` and `hopenLow`/`hopenUp`/`hdisj`
  are **discharged by construction** — you supply the region decomposition. The entire burden is
  `hfloor : ∀ y ∈ Zupper, ∀ s, ε ≤ y s`, a uniform coordinate floor.
- `hsep_fails_of_boundaryPoint_mem_sublevel` (`:184`) proves that once `x₀` and the boundary
  ω-point `wmax` are both in a convex sublevel, the segment between them takes value `(x₀ s)/n → 0`
  at any `s ∈ Pmax`. **So `hfloor` cannot be established for any convex region containing both
  endpoints** — which is exactly what the hole's hypotheses give.

## A-17. But that refutation does **not** transfer to the live target **[V]**

- **found-by:** `papers-craciun` · **round 1** · **revive-when:** never.
- In `exists_positive_omegaPoint_of_faceRelevantCore` (`:417`) the clause is
  `hsep : ∀ s : S, ∃ ε, 0 < ε ∧ ∀ x, x.Positive → StoichCompatible (γ x₀ 0) x →
  ⟪-m, euclideanStoichState x⟫ ≤ c → ε ≤ x s`.
- The quantifier ranges over **positive, compatible `x` on one side of a single affine
  hyperplane** — not over an ω-limit set containing a boundary point. The segment-to-`wmax`
  refutation needs `wmax` in the sublevel, and **`wmax` is not `Positive`, so `hsep`'s hypothesis
  `x.Positive` excludes it. The refutation does not transfer.**
- **This is the crack, and it is the entire reason the landing site is real.**

## A-18. **Every terminal criterion for Hole A is refuted or goal-equivalent** — VERDICT **[V]**

- **found-by:** `papers-cracuin` (analysis), verified by the orchestrator against the source.
- **Claim 1 — the `PersistentFrom` / `upperRegion` family is goal-equivalent, not weaker.**
  `PersistentOrbit.omegaLimit_positive` (`CRNT/Dynamics/GlobalPersistence.lean:159-162`) is

  ```lean
  theorem PersistentOrbit.omegaLimit_positive (hpers : PersistentOrbit ϕ x₀) :
      ∀ w ∈ omegaLimit atTop ϕ {x₀}, w.Positive
  ```

  **Universally** quantified over ω — not `∃`. Since `hwmax : wmax ∈ ω` and `hzeroMax` +
  `hPmaxne` give `¬ wmax.Positive`, **`PersistentOrbit` is refuted by the hole's own hypotheses.**
  `exists_positive_omegaPoint_of_upperRegion` composes precisely this theorem (`:1534-1536`), and
  `wmax` enters its `K` through `subset_closure (hstay t ht)` — by limits of `γ x₀ t`, forced by
  `hmaps` + `hK`, not by any membership test a supplied region can avoid. **No choice of `Zupper`
  avoids it.** Independently corroborated by `not_persistentFrom_of_mem_omegaLimit_notPositive`
  (`HighCodimensionSiphonFace.lean:407`).

- **Claim 2 — `ComparableGrowthDescent` is the goal renamed.**
  `CRNT/Dynamics/SiphonDimensionDescent.lean:368-377`:

  ```lean
  theorem comparableGrowthDescent_iff_omegaPointPositive
      (hP₀crit : N.IsCriticalSiphon P₀) (hP₀carr : N.SiphonCarried ϕ x₀ P₀) :
      N.ComparableGrowthDescent ϕ x₀ ↔ (∃ p ∈ omegaLimit atTop ϕ {x₀}, p.Positive)
  ```

  with `←` filled by `⟨fun _P _hne _hcrit _hcarr => Or.inl h⟩`. The module's own header at
  `:360-367` says it: "**no proof can assemble the structure** ... as a strictly weaker stepping
  stone to the goal."

- **Claim 3 — the `hsep` / `hfloor` family is refuted outright.** `form-barrier`'s compiled
  `CRNT/Dynamics/BlueprintRouteRefutation.lean` takes the hypotheses of
  `exists_positive_omegaPoint_of_blueprintData` plus hole A's ω-limit hypotheses and concludes
  `False`. Every rung — `blueprintData`, `selfConsistent_normals`, `convex_tiles`,
  `tiled_faceCores`, `faceRelevantCore`, `toric_blueprint`, `toric_halfspace` — routes through
  `exists_positive_omegaPoint_of_coordinate_floors` with `T = S`.

**WHAT THIS MEANS.** The fan exists and the embedding exists, and they are genuine assets. But
**"wire up the existing pieces" cannot close Hole A**: every terminal criterion in the tree is
either refuted or equivalent in difficulty to the hole's own conclusion. A researcher landing
`hm`, `hstart`, `hface`, `hcore`, or a `ComparableGrowthDescent` instance would be landing a
theorem equivalent to Hole A under another name, and reporting it as progress.

Hole A needs a genuinely new idea. That is a negative result about round 1's plan, **not** about
the hole. The hole may still be open and closable; what is closed is the family of routes this
round spent its budget exploring.

**Adversary note (carried to round 2):** the danger now is precisely that someone lands a
goal-equivalent theorem and the metric reads it as progress. `measure.py` counts `sorry`s, which
is honest, but the *round score* must apply the **−200 "provable only via a vacuous or
goal-equivalent step"** penalty from `research/README.md` §5 to any such landing.

## A-19. **The unifying structural fact: `Permanent` is refuted, so the whole ladder dies at once** **[V, compiled]**

- **found-by:** `form-barrier` (compiled), `arch-delta` and `papers-craciun` (independent analyses),
  all converging. **Orchestrator-side correction: the fork was contested and is now settled —
  `form-barrier` conceded after compiling the `False`-level theorem; its four refutation theorems
  stand, only its endgame verdict was wrong.**

- `def Permanent` (`CRNT/Dynamics/EndotacticPermanence.lean:58-60`) is
  `∃ K, IsCompact K ∧ (∀ y ∈ K, y.Positive) ∧ ∃ v ∈ atTop, closure (image2 ϕ v {x₀}) ⊆ K`, and
  `omegaLimit_meets_positive_of_permanent` derives `hpK : p ∈ K` via
  `omegaLimit_subset_closure_image2`. Since `v = univ` in `exists_positive_omegaPoint_of_upperRegion`'s
  call, **`ω ⊆ closure (orbit image) ⊆ K`**, and `hKpos : ∀ y ∈ K, y.Positive` is **universal**.
  So `Permanent` yields **`∀ w ∈ ω, w.Positive`**, while the hole asks only for
  `∃ p ∈ ω, p.Positive` *while permitting* boundary ω-points (`hwmax`, `hzeroMax`, `hPmaxne`).
  **The hole's hypotheses assert the negation of the universal form.**

- This is the same fact as `PersistentOrbit.omegaLimit_positive`
  (`GlobalPersistence.lean:159-162`, also universal), and it subsumes A-11…A-18 and every individual
  `hsep` refutation. **The structural statement:** every certificate in this tree that traps the
  orbit in a region floored away from the boundary *also traps the entire ω-limit set there*, and is
  therefore incompatible with the existence of a boundary ω-point. No choice of region, barrier or
  tile data avoids it.

- **Not a defect of Craciun.** Theorem D (every trajectory converges to `x*`) is consistent with `wmax`:
  `wmax` is a transient point on a ω-orbit. Craciun delivers `∀`; the hole needs `∃`. Different
  statements — which is why the packaged criteria cannot be instantiated here at all.

- **Every pre-packaged criterion is refuted:** `_of_upperRegion` (:1596),
  `_of_blueprintData`/`_selfConsistent_normals`/`_convex_tiles`,
  `_of_tiled_faceCores`/`_of_faceRelevantCore`, `_of_toric_blueprint`/`_of_toric_halfspace`, and
  anything concluding through a `PersistentFrom` certificate containing the orbit image.

- **The surviving target is `Network.omegaLimit_positive_of_descend`** (`SiphonDimensionDescent.lean:137`),
  whose single hypothesis `N.ComparableGrowthDescent ϕ x₀` is **not** touched by the above — it never
  passes through `Permanent`. But its sole field is
  `(∃ p ∈ ω, p.Positive) ∨ (∃ Q, … Q.card < P.card …)`, i.e. the goal disjoined from a strictly
  smaller siphon. Discharging it is exactly as hard as the hole, as the module's own header
  (`SiphonDimensionDescent.lean:360-367`) admits. **Hole A requires a genuinely new idea.**

## A-20. Craciun's Lemma 9.7 does **not** construct the surfaces **[V, transcribed from the PDF]**

- **found-by:** `papers-craciun` · **round 1** · **revive-when:** never.
- Lemma 9.7 is a **sufficient condition given** a family `{Z_ε̂}` per `ε̂`; it concludes
  `T₃` *cannot cross within `(0,1)³`*. §8 Step 2 needs it within `[0,M]^{n+1}` and bridges by
  "reason like in Subsection 6.1.3" — an unquantified proximity argument. So **"supply the blueprint
  data" was never something Lemma 9.7 did for anyone.**
- Clause 9.7(ii) is **simultaneous over all cones**: one normal `n_P` must lie in *every* applicable
  `C`. That is strictly stronger than the repo's `x.Positive`-guarded `hsep`, and it is the source of
  the `relint`-of-`K_C` condition that `CraciunZSH.hinterior` mistranscribes as `⊆ interior`.

## B-14. The RR arc builder already exists as **public** `glueArc` — do not lift the privacy modifier **[V]**

- **found-by:** `form-fanface-core.EmbeddingAudit` · **round 1** · **revive-when:** never.
- `arch-sr-case2`'s self-correction is right that `prepend` is `private noncomputable def`
  (`TrueSRParityRR.lean:276`) and unreachable. **But it is not the only route**: `prepend` is consumed
  internally by the **public** `glueArc {x y} (X : TrueSRPathRR x) (Y : TrueSRPathRR y)
  (h : RRGluable X Y) : TrueSRPath (2 * (y + 1) + 1)` at `:388-392`, which also carries the
  edge-disjointness and species-disjointness side conditions a hand-rolled builder would have to
  re-establish.
- Species-flavour public entry points: `glueWalk` (`TrueSRGlueMaps.lean`:233) and `glueCycle` (:245).
- **The work is constructing `RRGluable`/`Gluable` instances, not building paths. Do not lift the
  `private` modifier — that is the larger and less clean change.**

## B-15. All four port items are **absent** from `holes`, and so is the target **[V]**

- **found-by:** `form-fanface-core.EmbeddingAudit` · **round 1** · **revive-when:** never.
- Repo-wide grep for `lemmaA6_case2|offCycle_escape|SignDirected|sToRIntersectionOfTwoPaths` over
  `CRNT/` returns **no matches**. `exists_second_evenCycle_of_offCycle_escape` itself does not exist
  anywhere in the tree.
- So Hole B is **not a repair** — it is authoring five declarations from scratch (four ported items
  plus the target). The missing prerequisite is `SignDirected` (the sign condition that is
  B-12's `hSR.2`) together with the `RRGluable`/`Gluable` instances.

## A-21. "Frontier membership ⇒ sorry-bearing" is **FALSE**, and it was my error **[V]**

- **found-by:** `infra-build` (correction), attributed correctly by `FormScaffold.ScDefZero` to an
  **orchestrator assertion**, not to the agents.
- I asserted in a broadcast: "`HighCodimensionSiphonFace` is on the frontier (line 2), which is
  consistent with it carrying the tree's one executable `sorry` at :135." **That inference is
  wrong.** The frontier set is the set of modules Lean has *ever failed* to elaborate. A
  hole-bearing module still **elaborates** — with `sorryAx`. So frontier membership carries **no**
  information about holes, and "consistent with" was doing dishonest work.
- **How it propagated:** three agents treated my assertion as corroboration for their own
  independent claim, which laundered a bad orchestrator premise into an apparently-triangulated fact.
  **Record this because it is the swarm's characteristic failure mode in miniature: a confident
  orchestrator premise, accepted by three careful agents, is more dangerous than an agent's own
  error, because nobody re-derives it.**
- **What it licensed:** the claim "closing Hole A closes the GAC chain, one edge wide." On the
  correct method — `form-barrier`'s **transitive-import closure computation** from
  `GlobalAttractorTheorem` (326 modules) finding **exactly one** executable `sorry` at
  `HighCodimensionSiphonFace.lean:135` — that claim **stands**. It was derived from the right
  method. The frontier-membership remark was decoration on top of it, not its basis. But it must be
  **re-derived from `scripts/dump_sorries.py`**, never from frontier membership, whenever it is
  repeated.
- **Standing rule added to `research/README.md` §7:** a green `lake build` carries no information
  about holes, and neither does frontier membership. **Only `scripts/dump_sorries.py` and a
  transitive `#print axioms` carry information about holes.**

## A-22. **CORRECTION TO A-19 — the obstruction is the ∀/∃ mismatch, not `Permanent`** **[V]**

- **found-by:** `papers-cracuin` (correcting me), verified by the orchestrator.
- **I misattributed the mechanism.** `Permanent` is a *hypothesis* of the theorems at
  `EndotacticPermanence.lean:81` and `:116`; the hole never assumes it. Showing `Permanent` is
  *refutable* under the hole's hypotheses is therefore **not** by itself a refutation of Hole A —
  to bite, `Permanent` would have to be *derivable*, which it is not.
- **The obstruction that actually bites** is `PersistentOrbit.omegaLimit_positive`
  (`GlobalPersistence.lean:159-162`), whose conclusion is **`∀ w ∈ ω, w.Positive`**. The hole's
  hypotheses (`hwmax`, `hzeroMax`, `hPmaxne`) **assert its negation**. So any criterion concluding
  the universal form is unsatisfiable here. That — not `Permanent` — is why `_of_upperRegion` and
  the whole `hsep` family die.
- **Recording this so round 3 does not chase it:** A-entries citing `Permanent` send the next
  round after a criterion that was never the problem. The real statement is the `∀`/`∃` mismatch.

## A-23. **Hole A is NOT dead — it reduces to ONE unproved dynamical estimate** **[V, corrected]**

- **found-by:** `form-fanface-core.HoleContext`, verified by the orchestrator against the signature.
- **I over-stated A-19.** "Hole A needs a genuinely new idea" was wrong. What is dead is *every
  pre-packaged criterion in the tree*. That is a fact about the criteria, **not** about the hole.
- `CodimTwoFaceModel.lean` shows the hypotheses are satisfiable-with-false-conclusion **except
  `hsol`** — so it refutes *static* arguments only. `hsol` is the orbit-ODE premise, which is
  exactly what an Anderson-style descent consumes and what every refuted criterion ignores.
- **The reduction, verified:** `Network.omegaLimit_positive_of_boundary_point`
  (`SiphonDimensionDescent.lean:159`) has signature
  `hϕγ hK hmaps hωnn hgenω hωaff hx0pos hdesc hw hs₁ → ∃ p ∈ ω, p.Positive`
  — **the hole's hypotheses minus all the `Pmax` data, plus `hdesc`.** Hence

  ```lean
  exists_positive_omegaPoint_of_highCodimension_siphonFace
    = fun … hdesc => omegaLimit_positive_of_boundary_point … hdesc hwmax
        (hzeroMax ⟨s₀, hPmaxne⟩).2
  ```

  a three-line wrapper. `hxs`/`hcb` then go unused, and `hcodim`, `hcard`, `hrank`, `hmaxExact`,
  `hzcard` are derivable or redundant (:1034, :1053, :1090).
- **The single unformalised object is `ComparableGrowthDescent.descend`**
  (`SiphonDimensionDescent.lean:125-132`): `∀ P, P.Nonempty → IsCriticalSiphon P → SiphonCarried P →
  (∃ p ∈ ω, p.Positive) ∨ (∃ Q, … Q.card < P.card …)`. Its **right disjunct is the analytic
  estimate** the file itself flags as blocked at :531-534; the conservation mechanism
  `eq_zero_on_pmax_of_conservation_eq` (:569) is the missing half.
- **So the honest entry is: "Hole A is closed under all packaged criteria; its residue is a single
  unproved descent estimate, reachable by a three-line wrapper."** That is a *dynamical* estimate,
  which is why `CodimTwoFaceModel` does not touch it.

## A-24. `HighCodimensionSiphonFace.lean:73-76` makes a **false axiom-hygiene claim** **[V]**

- **found-by:** `adv-audit.DriftA`. The "Trust status" block asserts: *"`#print axioms …` reports
  `sorryAx`, and so do exactly its downstream consumers … **No other declaration in the tree does.**"*
- **False.** A tree-wide scan for `^\s*sorry\b` returns exactly two sites —
  `HighCodimensionSiphonFace.lean:135` **and** `TrueChemistrySRCriterion.lean:8607`. It is false in
  the one file whose subject matter is axiom hygiene.
- Docstring-only, cannot break a build, and the cheapest real fix available anywhere. **Round 2
  should land it regardless of what happens to either hole.**

## B-16. The RR arc needs **no** privacy lift and no bespoke builder **[V]**

- `RRGluable` (`TrueSRParityRR.lean:260`) has fields `same_start` :262, `same_end` :264,
  `species_disjoint` :266, `reaction_disjoint` :268, `edge_disjoint` :270.
  `Gluable` (`TrueSRGlueInterface.lean:59`) has `same_start` :60, `same_end` :61,
  `species_disjoint` :62, `reaction_disjoint` :64, `edge_disjoint` :66, plus **public**
  `Gluable.symm` :69.
- `glueArc` (:388) calls the *private* `prepend` internally — legal within the file — so **no
  privacy lift is needed**. Typing note: `prepend`'s receiver is `TrueSRPathRR`, so the
  `speciesArc.toPath.prepend` route is **type-invalid**; build `TrueSRPathRR` from public
  accessors (`vertexAt`/`edgeAt`/`startReaction`/`endReaction`, simp lemmas :99-123), then glue.
- `TrueSRGlueInterface.lean` does **not** import `TrueChemistrySRCriterion` — so the ported file can
  avoid the `sorryAx` coupling (B-11).
- `TrueSRGlueInterface.lean:55-57` notes the `edge_disjoint` clause is what Banaji–Craciun's
  Lemma 10 supplies directly, and that **interior disjointness for a *simple* cycle is not carried
  out there** — a known residual to flag, not to assume away.

## A-25. **`hm` is VACUOUS — `m := 0` satisfies it** **[V]**

- **found-by:** `arch-fanface` · **round 1** · **revive-when:** never as stated.
- `hm : m ∈ N.faceRelevantCore P δ B hcore` is the **only** constraint on `m`, and `faceRelevantCore`
  is a `ProperCone` — a `ClosedSubmodule ℝ≥0 E` (Mathlib `Analysis/Convex/Cone/Basic.lean:61`) —
  which **always contains `0`**. So `m := 0` satisfies `hm`.
- **Do not read progress into instantiating `hm`.** It needs strengthening to `m ≠ 0` **plus** the
  dominance clause. **This trap survives the death of the criteria** and will bite whoever rebuilds
  them: the input that looks like the geometric content of the blueprint is satisfied by zero.

## B-17. **CORRECTION TO B-14 — `glueArc` is NOT the RR arc builder** **[V]**

- **found-by:** `arch-sr-case2` · **round 1** · **retracts B-14's first claim.**
- `glueArc {x y} (X : TrueSRPathRR x) (Y : TrueSRPathRR y) (h : RRGluable X Y) : TrueSRPath (…)`
  (`TrueSRParityRR.lean:388`) takes **two `TrueSRPathRR` values and their `RRGluable` as INPUT** and
  returns a `TrueSRPath`. **It cannot build either of its own inputs, so it is circular as an arc
  builder.**
- **What still stands from B-14/B-16:** the `private` modifier on `prepend` still needs **no** lift —
  `glueArc` calls it internally at :390, which is legal within the file. And `TrueSRPathRR` is a
  plain structure whose `tail` is an ordinary `TrueSRPath`, so an arc is a **structure literal**,
  needing no `prepend` at all. There is no `take`/`init` on `TrueSRPath` (`TrueSRPath.lean:34-37`),
  so a tail must be a literal of length `2*(m-1)+1`.
- **The real prerequisite is unchanged:** constructing `RRGluable` (fields at `:262` `same_start`,
  `:264` `same_end`, `:266` `species_disjoint`, `:268` `reaction_disjoint`, `:270` `edge_disjoint`)
  and `Gluable` (`TrueSRGlueInterface.lean:59`, plus public `Gluable.symm` at `:69`). **That is
  authoring, not building.**

## Durable Tier C work, true regardless of any fork **[V]**

- **The min-max analogue of `barrier_le_of_mem_omegaLimit` is absent.** `HighCodimensionSiphonFace.lean:272`
  has the single-barrier version; grep finds no `minMaxBarrier` there. The union-barrier
  ω-limit closure step is missing. `isClosed_minMaxSublevel` (`PolyhedralBarrier.lean:444`) already
  exists, so this should be mechanical. **True regardless of how the criteria fare.**
- **`(N.faceRelevantCones Pmax δ B).Nonempty` for the source-order fan is not established.** It
  should follow from `Network.deltaCore_mem` / `nearCones_nonempty` plus `IsPolyhedralFan.covers`,
  by the same argument as `CRNT.IsPolyhedralFan.nearCones_nonempty` (`FanFaceLattice.lean`). Cheap
  and mechanical.
- **`Fan E` is an axiom-free `abbrev`** for `Finset (ProperCone ℝ E)` (`ToricFan.lean:50`), so
  `toricField` needs no predicate. `IsPolyhedralFan` (`ConeFace.lean:196`) carries `faces_mem`,
  `inter_common`, `covers`, and `.negated` is proved at `:242`. `Refines` (`FanRefinement.lean:94`)
  is `⊆`-only (A-5). `HasDualFGCells` at `:981`.
- **Check whether `docs/gac-bridge-gap-analysis.lean`'s `ContinuousOn` discharge covers
  `hΓcont : ContinuousOn (γ x₀) (Ici 0)`.** This is a fact about the hole's *own* hypotheses, not a
  criterion input, so the freeze does not apply. The hole supplies `hsol` (`HasDerivAt` for all
  `t ≥ 0`) and `hgenω` (ω-points only); if the bridge closes the forward-ray case, one of the three
  orbit-level gaps is already gone.

## A-26. **ADJUDICATED AND MACHINE-CHECKED — the upper-region criterion is inapplicable** **[V, compiled]**

- **found-by:** `infra-scaffold-crnt`, branch `research/infrascaffold`, commit `ffc02b2`.
  New file `CRNT/Dynamics/UpperRegionFloorRefutation.lean`, imported from `CRNT.lean`.
- **Independently verified by the orchestrator:** `research/scripts/checkmod.sh` reports
  `=== OK (sorry-warnings: 0) ===`. No `sorry`, no `axiom`.
- `false_of_upperRegion_and_boundaryOmegaPoint` (:107) takes **every** hypothesis of
  `exists_positive_omegaPoint_of_upperRegion` — **including `hfloor`** — plus the hole's `hwmax`,
  `hPmaxne`, `hzeroMax`, and concludes `False`. **So `hfloor` is not an unbuilt input awaiting
  discharge; it is unsatisfiable.**
- `positive_omegaLimit_of_confinedToFlooredRegion` (:171) is the bare mechanism with **no**
  reaction-network structure: orbit confined to a floored region ⟹ every ω-point is positive.
- **Why the fork looked contested and was not:** `hfloor` *looks* like a region floor, so it seems to
  escape orbit-level obstructions — but the criterion consumes it through `closure_minimal`, i.e. as
  a statement about `closure Zupper`, and ω-limit points lie in the closure of the orbit image
  (`omegaLimit_subset_closure_image2`), which lies in `Zupper` (`orbit_stays_in_upperRegion`).
  **Steps 1–3 alone give `∀ s, ε ≤ wmax s`.** Neither the entropy level nor compactness is needed.
- **This supersedes the contested verdict of A-19/A-22 and is now the settled one.** `hm`,
  `hstart`, `hface`, `hcore` for `exists_positive_omegaPoint_of_faceRelevantCore` are **known-dead**.
  Do not spend budget on them. And note **A-25**: even before death, `hm` was vacuous (`m := 0`).

## A-27. **151 proved, hole-free modules sit in Hole A's import closure and are never used** **[V, computed]**

- **found-by:** `infra-scaffold-crnt`, `docs/hole-reachability.md` on `research/infrascaffold`.
- Computed from `import` lines plus short-name occurrence — **not curated, so it is checkable**.
  Headline entries: `ComplexBalanceStoichFan` (20 declarations, the source-order polyhedral fan),
  `ComplexBalanceStoichFanInclusion` (38 declarations, the Theorem 4.3 embedding),
  `FaceDirectionCone`.
- **This is the durable Tier C payoff and it survives every refutation above.** The fan and the
  embedding are real, proved, and compiled into Hole A's dependency cone without being called.
  Whatever replaces the dead criteria will need them.

## A-28. **THE GENERAL TEMPLATE — one theorem retires the whole family** **[V, compiled]**

- **found-by:** `infra-scaffold-crnt`, `Network.universalPositive_omegaLimit_of_closedPositiveConfine`.
- `sorryAx`-free, and containing **no** floor, no `ε`, no concentration structure, and no reaction
  network — a bare set-theoretic condition:

  ```lean
  theorem universalPositive_omegaLimit_of_closedPositiveConfine
      (hKc : IsClosed K) (hKpos : ∀ y ∈ K, y.Positive) (hv : v ∈ atTop)
      (hvK : closure (Set.image2 ϕ v {x₀}) ⊆ K) : ∀ y ∈ omegaLimit atTop ϕ {x₀}, y.Positive
  ```

- **The hole asks for `∃ p ∈ ω, p.Positive` while *permitting* a boundary ω-point. This yields the
  *universal* form, which is exactly the negation of that permission.** So `Permanent`,
  `exists_positive_omegaPoint_of_upperRegion`,
  `not_persistentFrom_of_mem_omegaLimit_notPositive` and the entire `hsep` family die for **one
  structural reason**, not four.
- **Retire the `Permanent` citations.** `papers-cracuin` was right that `Permanent` is a hypothesis
  the hole never assumes, so it cannot be what refutes it. `Permanent` is merely one way of
  discharging this template's hypotheses. **Cite `universalPositive_omegaLimit_of_closedPositiveConfine`,
  not `Permanent`.**

## A-29. **Four agents landed the same `False`-level theorem — consolidation required** **[V]**

- Compilations of the same verdict: `UpperRegionFloorRefutation.lean` (`infra-scaffold-crnt`, 3
  theorems), `UpperRegionObstruction.lean` (`adv-refute`), `UpperRegionAdjudication.lean`
  (`adv-audit`), `BlueprintRouteRefutation.lean` (`form-barrier`, 8 theorems).
- **Consolidation agreed, with `infra-scaffold-crnt` as owner** — its factoring separates the bare
  mechanism from the CRNT-level `False`, which is the right factoring.
- **What is a duplicate and should reduce to a one-line corollary:** `false_of_upperRegion…` (×3)
  and `positive_omegaLimit_of_confinedToFlooredRegion` (now strictly subsumed by A-28).
- **What is NOT duplication and must be kept:**
  * `adv-audit`'s `comparableGrowthDescent_is_not_a_weaker_route` — orthogonal to all of the above,
    and load-bearing, because it removes the last fallback the hole's own docstring names at
    `:167-171`.
  * `form-barrier`'s `blueprintData_inconsistent_with_highCodimension` — a *different and larger*
    claim (kills the whole ladder), plus `no_uniform_floor_along_orbit_of_boundaryOmegaPoint`
    (barrier-free).
- **Four copies of one theorem is worse than one:** a reviewer has to check four.

## A-30. "Unused" ≠ "unavailable", and much of the unused capability is now unreachable **[V]**

- `docs/hole-reachability.md`'s capability table overstates what is actionable. The fan
  (`ComplexBalanceStoichFan`, 20 decls) and its inclusion (`ComplexBalanceStoichFanInclusion`,
  38 decls) are in the **transitive closure** — via
  `ToricBarrierTrapping → FanFaceLattice → ComplexBalanceStoichFanInclusion → ComplexBalanceStoichFan` —
  unused only in the *file body*. Both facts are now separate columns in the generated doc.
- **But by A-28, any module in the closure that discharges orbit-confinement via a closed positive
  set is unreachable here.** The fan and its inclusion are exactly that: real infrastructure, no
  live consumer. The `∀`-form rows will be marked rather than left looking like missed
  opportunities. **A-27 must be read with this caveat.**

## A-31. **SCOPE CORRECTION TO A-28 — the template does NOT reach the `hsep` family** **[V]**

- **found-by:** `form-fanface-core.FanExists`. My DECISION 2 broadcast overstated A-28 by one
  theorem; this correction is adopted.
- `universalPositive_omegaLimit_of_closedPositiveConfine` retires the **closed-positive-confinement**
  family: `Permanent`, `exists_positive_omegaPoint_of_upperRegion`,
  `not_persistentFrom_of_mem_omegaLimit_notPositive` — criteria whose hypotheses *do* supply a
  closed set with universal positivity.
- **It does NOT reach the `hsep` family.** `hsep` is a coordinate-separation clause. Its refutation
  goes through `floor_on_omegaLimit_of_floor_along_orbit` — **barrier-free, no `K`, no `IsClosed`** —
  which is a different shape of argument entirely.
- **My own record was internally inconsistent on this:** DECISION 2 claimed the template killed the
  whole `hsep` family while simultaneously preserving
  `no_uniform_floor_along_orbit_of_boundaryOmegaPoint` as KEEP. The preserved lemma is the one that
  actually does the work.
- **Correct way to cite A-28:** *the closed-positive-confinement family dies by A-28; the `hsep`
  family dies by the floor-along-orbit lemma; **cite both**.* Anyone who tries to discharge an
  `hsep` refutation through the template will fail and may re-open a closed question.

## A-32. **REFINEMENT TO A-25 — `hm` vacuous does not by itself kill `faceRelevantCore`** **[V]**

- **found-by:** same. A-25 reads stronger than it is.
- `faceRelevantCore` is `relevantCore`, a `Finset.inf'` of `ProperCone`s, hence a `PointedCone`, and
  `subfanCore_le` gives it as an order-preserving lower bound of each member. **`hm` is used to
  derive `⟪-m, ẋ⟩ ≥ 0` for the mass-action field, and `m := 0` makes that vacuous — but that does not
  make the criterion vacuous**, since `hstart`, `hface` and `hsep` still carry content.
- **So A-25 rules out "supply `hm` and the geometry bites." It does not by itself kill
  `faceRelevantCore`** — that kill comes from the criterion's other clauses (ultimately A-31's
  floor-along-orbit argument).
- **Precision matters here because both entries are already cited as settled.**

## A-33. **CORRECTION TO A-23 — "three-line wrapper" is the wrong phrasing** **[V]**

- **found-by:** `form-scaffold.ScDefZero`. **The file/line attribution was crossed.**
  `omegaLimit_positive_of_boundary_point` is in **`CRNT/Dynamics/SiphonDimensionDescent.lean:158`**,
  *not* `HighCodimensionSiphonFace.lean:159` — line 159 of that file is inside the module docstring.
- **It is not a wrapper *over* the residue; it is the residue's consumer.** It takes the boundary
  ω-point as *data* (`hw`, `hs₁`) **plus `hdesc` itself**, and consumes `descend` directly at
  `:213`. The three lines relabel where the dependency sits; they do not remove it.
- **Say "one wrapper + one unproved estimate", never "three-line wrapper."** The second phrasing
  invites exactly the misreading that Hole A is nearly closed. **It is not.**

## A-34. `descend` is unproved as a whole, and `:569` is a *different* open item **[V]**

- **found-by:** same. `ComparableGrowthDescent.descend` is at
  `SiphonDimensionDescent.lean:125-132` (that attribution was right) — but it is a **disjunction whose
  left disjunct is already the goal**. The unproved half is the **strict-shrinking alternative**,
  which the docstring at `:120-124` calls "the content not formalised here".
- **So the honest statement is that `descend` is unproved** — not that a sub-part of it is.
- **`eq_zero_on_pmax_of_conservation_eq` (`:569`) is NOT `descend`'s missing half.** It is the
  conservation-law pin for branch (I), a separate open item. A-23 merged two distinct open problems;
  they are now separated.

## A-35. **CORRECTION TO A-30 — "no live consumer" overstates it** **[V]**

- **found-by:** `form-fanface-core.HoleContext`. A-30 (and A-27) are wrong to say the fan and its
  inclusion have no live consumer.
- A-28 retires modules that **conclude by discharging orbit-confinement into a closed positive set**.
  **`ComplexBalanceStoichFanInclusion` is not of that kind.** Its Theorem-4.3 instance
  `massActionVectorField_mem_toricField_relativeSourceOrderNegativeStoichFan` (`:373`) needs exactly
  `hxs`, `hcb`, forward-time positivity from `N.genuineOrbit_pos`, and `hδ : 0 < δ` — **all four
  available at the hole itself, with no extra input.** It is a **pointwise statement about the
  velocity field**, not a confinement argument, so A-28 does not reach it.
- **Accurate marking: "no live consumer *among the permanence criteria*".**
- And for the endgame: the surviving Hole A object concludes **directly from a descent step and
  never mentions the fan** — which is precisely why the fan's 58 declarations have no consumer, and
  why that will **not change** when `descend` is proved. A table left reading "no live consumer"
  will cause the next agent to re-open the fan route on the strength of it.

## A-36. Do **not** re-land `comparableGrowthDescent_is_not_a_weaker_route` — it is already in-tree **[V]**

- **found-by:** `arch-alt`. It is the same statement, same hypotheses, as
  `comparableGrowthDescent_iff_omegaPointPositive` (`SiphonDimensionDescent.lean:368-377`), and
  `SiphonDimensionDescent` is **already in Hole A's import closure**.
- DECISION 1 listed it as work to keep. It is **not new work.** The *decision* it supports is
  correct and load-bearing — it removes the fallback named at the hole's `:167-171` — but landing a
  copy would be the fifth instance of this round's recurring failure, **created rather than
  inherited**. Cite the in-tree theorem.

## A-37. A-36's deeper point: the descent route is **circular, and the tree says so** **[V]**

- Anyone told "three-line wrapper" will spend an hour rediscovering that
  `comparableGrowthDescent_iff_omegaPointPositive` (`:368`) and
  `descendStep_iff_omegaPointPositive_of_cardMinimal` (`:344`, the cardinality-minimal case, which is
  precisely `Pmax`'s situation) make "assemble the descent structure" **equivalent to the goal**.
- **Say: "the estimate *is* hole A, not a lemma hole A consumes."** `eq_zero_on_pmax_of_conservation_eq`
  (`:569`) is not "the missing half" of something otherwise provable — its own docstring records that
  the obstruction is that `IsCriticalSiphon Pmax` forbids the invariant it needs.

## A-38. Precision on A-28: closed-positive confinement is **not** impossible in general **[V]**

- **found-by:** `arch-fanface`. `universalPositive_omegaLimit_of_closedPositiveConfine` yields the
  universal form. **The contradiction is not that closed-positive confinement is impossible — it is
  that the hole *simultaneously* supplies `hwmax`, `hzeroMax` and `hPmaxne`.** A network with no
  boundary ω-point satisfies the template's hypotheses happily. One sentence of this, so A-28 cannot
  be misread as a general impossibility claim.

## A-39. **MY CITED LINE NUMBERS WERE FABRICATED — `SiphonDimensionDescent.lean` IS 382 LINES** **[V]**

- **found-by:** `form-fanface-core.EmbeddingAudit`, and it is a direct hit on the charter amendment
  I had just written.
- I cited **`SiphonDimensionDescent.lean:531-534`** (the "blocked" flag) and **`:569`**
  (`eq_zero_on_pmax_of_conservation_eq`) in A-23, A-28 broadcasts, and the closing summary.
  **The file is 382 lines. Those line numbers are beyond EOF and cannot exist.**
- I took them from `form-fanface-core.HoleContext`'s report and propagated them through several
  entries and multiple broadcasts **without checking them against the file** — which is precisely the
  failure mode `research/README.md` §8 was written to forbid, committed in the same session that
  wrote it.
- **Consequence:** every ledger entry citing `:531-534` or `:569` in that file is suspect and must be
  re-derived. **A-23's "the missing half is `eq_zero_on_pmax_of_conservation_eq` (`:569`)" is
  unsupported** and should not be relied on. The *structure* of the claim — that the residue is
  `ComparableGrowthDescent.descend`, whose analytic content is unformalised — is independently
  supported by `SiphonDimensionDescent.lean:116-123` and `:25-27`, which I have now read:
  > `:116-123` "In the analytic proof the strict shrinking is forced by comparing the growth of the
  > relative-entropy Lyapunov family across an escape from the face `SiphonFace P`; that estimate is
  > **the content not formalised here**."
  > `:25-27` "The single genuinely analytic ingredient — Anderson's comparable-growth Lyapunov-family
  > estimate … is isolated as the predicate `Network.ComparableGrowthDescent`."
- **Verified line numbers in that file, for anyone continuing:** the `descend` field at `:124-133`;
  `omegaLimit_positive_of_boundary_point` at `:158-178`; `isCriticalSiphon_of_siphonCarried` at `:68`
  (used at `:177`); `descendStep_of_carried_card_lt` at `:288`;
  `exists_cardMinimal_carried_siphon_lt` at `:324`;
  `descendStep_iff_omegaPointPositive_of_cardMinimal` at `:347`;
  `comparableGrowthDescent_iff_omegaPointPositive` at `:369-377`;
  `siphonCarried_of_escape` at `:39-42`.
- **Rule, now enforced on myself:** *never* cite a `file:line` I have not read in this session, even
  when a peer supplies one. §8 says broadcasts must cite a line actually read; that applies to
  relayed citations too, and I violated it four times in one round.

## API-1. Dot-notation on `Concentration S` does **not** resolve to `namespace Concentration` **[V]**

- **found-by:** `form-scaffold` · round 1 · **revive-when:** never.
- `Concentration S := S → ℝ` (`CRNT/Kinetics/Concentration.lean:19`). Lean resolves field notation for
  a `Pi` type in **`namespace Function`**, so `x.zeroSet` and even `Concentration.x.zeroSet` both
  fail. **The working form is explicit application `Concentration.zeroSet x`**, which then needs
  parentheses before `.card` / `∈` / `⊆`.
- This cost several full elaboration rounds and will bite **anyone extending the CRNT concentration
  API.** It presents as a cascade of unrelated errors, not as a notation problem.

## API-2. `StoichCompatible.refl` is a field projection, not an applied theorem **[V]**

- **found-by:** `form-scaffold` · round 1 · **revive-when:** never.
- Must be applied as `StoichCompatible.refl N x₀`, **not** `N.StoichCompatible.refl x₀`.
  Same for `stoichCompatible_iff_exists_sub`: `.mpr` needs explicit arguments
  `(N.stoichCompatible_iff_exists_sub x0 y).mpr`, since it is not an `Iff` field on a structure.

## API-3. `Concentration.zeroSet` must be `noncomputable` **[V]**

- **found-by:** `form-scaffold` · round 1 · **revive-when:** never.
- `noncomputable def zeroSet` is required even though the body is just `Finset.univ.filter`,
  because it depends on `Real.decidableEq`. Declaring it `def` yields a
  **`lean.dependsOnNoncomputable` error, not an elaboration error** — so it reads as a cascade of
  unrelated downstream failures rather than as one declaration being wrong.

## A-40. "A strictly positive conservation law separates two class points" is **FALSE** **[V]**

- **found-by:** `form-scaffold`, caught in its own draft before landing. Recorded so it is not
  re-attempted.
- The draft claimed `weightedTotal_ne_of_…`: that a strictly positive conservation law separates
  two stoichiometric-compatible points by their weighted totals. **`CRNT.Flux.PSemiflow.weightedTotal_eq_of_stoichCompatible`
  says the weighted total is _equal_ on any two compatible points.**
- **The usable form is conservation _exclusion_ of the whole `P`-face** (`CompatibilityFaces`), not
  point separation.
- `research/FormScaffold` records the correct form as
  `weightedTotal_eq_of_stoichCompatible_is_the_correct_statement` so the false variant cannot be
  re-attempted.

## WIP branch status (not contributions) **[V]**

- `research/FormScaffold` carries **three drafted modules that do not currently elaborate**:
  `CRNT/Equilibria/CompatibilityClassGeometry.lean` (8 errors remaining),
  `CRNT/Geometry/CompatibilityClassInvariants.lean`,
  `CRNT/Dynamics/EntryLossFunction.lean` (never checked past first draft).
  **Zero verified lemmas.** Pushed as WIP so round 2 resumes rather than restarts. **Not a
  contribution.**
- Of these, `EntryLossFunction.lean` is genuinely absent from the whole tree (per A-8), and
  `CompatibilityClassGeometry.lean`'s section C — `exists_maximal_zeroSetOf_card_le`, aimed at
  Hole A's `hmaxExact` with the ω-limit quantifier replaced by an arbitrary family of class points —
  is the most valuable and the closest to done.

## B-18. `hopp` is a **sign condition with no path content**; the forcing comes from elsewhere **[V, compiled]**

- **found-by:** `form-sr-hopp`, PR #11. **What `hopp` is:** binder at
  `TrueChemistrySRCriterion.lean:8039` —
  `∀ i, (trueInternalClassFlux α (C.reaction (finRotate n i)) (C.species (finRotate n i))) * σ (C.species (finRotate n i)) < 0`.
  It is pointwise, with **no path content at all**. Its only use at the residue is line 8497.
- `CRNT.hopp_alone_insufficient` is an **exact counterexample on `Fin 3`** satisfying `hopp` in the
  literal :8039 form and failing uniqueness. The forcing comes from `hcausal` (:8036) together with
  non-neighbour cycle-class flux vanishing (negated `hnc` at :8537) — **neither is named in the
  residue's comment.**
- Sharpens **B-8**: on *cycle* classes those three hypotheses **do** force the target uniquely, and
  `hopp` is **not** among the two load-bearing ones for the forward direction.

## B-19. The residue comment's target is **wrong by one rotation** — machine-checked **[V, compiled]**

- `Network.no_oneStep_to_pos_of_cycleSpecies : False`. There is no aggregate causal hop
  `C.species j → C.reaction ((finRotate n).symm j)`, which is exactly what `C.reaction (pos s₀)`
  denotes under the residue's own convention (`s₀ = C.species (finRotate n i)` at :8052; endpoint
  `qC.1 = C.reaction i` at :8219). The genuine one-hop target is **`C.reaction j = C.leftEdge j`**.
- Under the other reading of `pos` the step is right but is **still not the path's endpoint for
  `n ≥ 2`**. **The comment misidentifies the endpoint under either reading.**

## B-20. The correct statement is proved, and the on-cycle route has length **2n−1** **[V, compiled]**

- `Network.oneStep_fromCycleSpecies_eq_leftEdge` (residue's vocabulary) and
  `CRNT.firstHop_forced_leftEdge` (**CRNT-free core**), plus `Network.leftEdge_step_exists` and
  `Network.onCycle_out_neighbour_leftEdge`.
- **The structural fact: the aggregate causal graph induced on cycle vertices is the directed cycle
  `s_j → r_j → s_{j+1} → r_{j+1} → …`.** So an on-cycle route from `C.species (finRotate n i)` to
  `C.reaction i` has length **2n−1, never 1.** This is the real shape the residue's comment should
  have described.
- Axiom audit: all 19 declarations report exactly `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.
  `TrueSRFirstHopCycle.lean` **does** import `TrueChemistrySRCriterion` — necessarily, since the
  statements are in its vocabulary — and is **still `sorryAx`-free**: the criterion's `sorry` is on
  no dependency path of these declarations. Checked, not assumed.
- **This is the B-11 constraint satisfied in the hardest possible way**: a module that imports the
  hole-bearing file and is nonetheless axiom-clean. Worth citing as the template for the A.6 port.

## B-21. Two free byproducts for the residue **[V, compiled]**

- **`m = 1` is already excluded outright by `hQ0late` (:8359).** The `m = 1 ∧ s₀ = s` split at
  :8587-8599 is therefore **redundant**, and `m` is odd with `m ≥ 3`. That is a cleanup in an
  8641-line file for free.
- Combined with **B-19**: `Q0`'s first hop out of `s₀` must land on an **off-cycle** class, and
  **where it lands is not determined by `hopp`.** That is the precise remaining freedom, and it is
  what the A.6 Case-2 port (B-9, absent from `holes`) has to close.

## ENV-1. Mathlib submodule imports have no local `.olean` **[V]**

- `Mathlib.Tactic.Omega` and `Mathlib.Data.Fin.Tuple.FinOps` have **no `.olean`** in the local
  build, while the umbrella `Mathlib.Tactic` does. **New modules should import the umbrella**, or
  they will fail for an environmental reason that looks like a missing dependency.

## B-22. The `hopp_alone_insufficient` counterexample, explicit **[V, compiled]**

- **found-by:** `form-sr-hopp`, PR #11. Reproduce rather than re-derive this; it is exact.
- On `Fin 3` with `σs ≡ 1`, flux matrix `φ a j`:

  ```
          b=0   b=1   b=2
    a=0    -1    0    0
    a=1     0   -1   -1
    a=2     0    0   -1
  ```

  Every diagonal term is `-1 < 0`, so `hopp` holds **in its literal `:8039` form**. Yet
  `φ 1 2 = -1 < 0` with `1 ≠ 2` — i.e. the target is **not** uniquely forced by `hopp` alone.
- **Origin and sign convention of `hopp`, for anyone continuing:**
  * it descends from `hneg` in `trueSRCycle_of_simple_aggregate_cycle` (`:8023`);
  * its only use at the residue is `:8497` (`hopp ((finRotate n).symm k)`), closing one case of the
    final edge of a reversed path;
  * the same binder also appears in `no_degree_two_aggregate_causal_cycle` (`:4534`) and
    `sharpened_source_inequality_at_cycle_separator` (`:7114`);
  * sign convention (`TrueInternalAggregateCausalEdge`, `:4691`):
    `Sum.inl s → Sum.inr ρ` ⟺ `flux * σ < 0`, and `Sum.inr ρ → Sum.inl s` ⟺ `0 < flux * σ`;
  * since `C.leftEdge j` has species `C.species j` and reaction `C.reaction j`
    (`TrueChemistrySRGraph.lean:141-144`), **`hopp` re-indexed by `(finRotate n).symm` says exactly
    that the cycle's leftEdge at `j` is a species-to-reaction causal edge.**

## B-23. `firstHop_forced_leftEdge` **deliberately omits `hopp`** — note the asymmetry **[V, compiled]**

- `CRNT.firstHop_forced_leftEdge` takes `hz` (non-neighbour vanishing), `hcausal`, and
  `h : φ a j * σs j < 0`, and concludes `a = j`. **`hopp` is not a hypothesis and the proof term
  does not mention it.** That is the cleanest possible statement that the residue comment's stated
  reason is wrong.
- Proof shape: `a ≠ j` forces `j.1 = (a.1+1) % n` (else `hz` gives `0`), whence `finRotate n a = j`,
  and `hcausal a` gives `0 < φ a j σs j` — contradiction.
- **The mirror result `CRNT.hop_backward_forced` shows the asymmetry is real:** a hop from a cycle
  reaction into `C.species j` comes from `C.reaction ((finRotate n).symm j`, and **there `hopp` IS
  load-bearing** (it kills the self hop). So `hopp` earns its keep in the *backward* direction only.
- **`CRNT.shortest_hop_is_leftEdge`:** at every cycle species `s_j` the on-cycle causal out-neighbours
  form exactly the singleton `{C.reaction j}`, attained in one hop.

## A-40. **Hole A's statement is NOT refutable — the search failed, and that is the finding** **[V]**

- **found-by:** `adv-refute`, PR #6. **This is the first positive result about Hole A in the whole
  round: the statement survived. It is not broken, only open.**
- **Search performed:** exhaustive over all **first-order** networks on **2–4 species** with **≤ 4
  ordered reactions**, with exact `Fraction` certification via SVD nullspace. Result:
  `nets=852, rank_ok=822, cb=31, traj=62, hits=0`. **Zero counterexamples.**
- **Statement audit:** no exploitable formulation gap found. `Concentration S = S → ℝ`, the linear
  `Submodule` formulation of `StoichCompatible`, and the coordinate-only `projOn` are each guarded
  downstream — and **`projOn`'s weakness makes `hcodim` _stricter_, not looser.** The hole's Lean
  statement is not a weaker-than-intended shadow of the classical GAC statement.
- **Combined with A-23/A-37**, Hole A stands as: statement not refuted, search to first order
  exhausted with no hit, residue is one unproved dynamical estimate the tree proves equivalent to the
  goal, and every packaged criterion machine-checked dead. **That is a coherent, honest picture,
  not a dead end.**

## A-41. **Two of `adv-refute`'s own "no counterexample" results were ARTEFACTS — read this before trusting any of them** **[V]**

- **Artefact 1.** Phase 1 reported `cb = 0` on **every** network, and nearly filed "no counterexample
  found". The cause: the test searched for a positive kernel vector in the **range of `Mᵀ`** instead
  of in **`ker M`**. Complex balance for a first-order network is exactly `M x = 0` with `x > 0`.
- **Artefact 2.** An earlier loose run produced a **hit** on a 4-species network. It was a
  **float-precision false positive** of the complex-balance test; exact re-verification killed it.
- **The honest limit, stated without spin:** in phase 2 every certified network was **weakly
  reversible** (`cb_certified == cb_wr` on all four seeds, 6000 networks, `hits=0`). The
  **non-weakly-reversible complex-balanced case is essentially UNSEARCHED** — and that is precisely
  where an exotic counterexample would most plausibly live. A phase 3 with exact symbolic (`sympy`)
  certification on structured non-WR families is the obvious next step and **was not done.**

## RULE (tier-wide, from A-41) — a negative result ships with its certification method **[V]**

> **A "no counterexample" claim is only as trustworthy as the method that produced it.** Any
> adversarial claim about Hole A or Hole B must ship, in the same commit: the search space
> (species count, reaction bound, class of networks), the exactness of the arithmetic
> (`Fraction`/`sympy`/formal — never floats), and **what was left unsearched**.

Two of `adv-refute`'s own results failed this and were caught only by re-checking. A float-precision
test is not a refutation engine. **This rule extends to every `[V]` grade in this file whose
evidence is computational rather than source-read** — those are the ones a later reader cannot
re-derive by reading the code.

## OPS-1. `reset --hard` on an unpushed branch is unrecoverable-in-principle **[V]**

- **found-by:** `adv-refute`, which destroyed its own branch pointer mid-rebase and recovered from
  reflog. **Recovered clean, but that was luck.**
- **Push before rebasing.** A `git reset --hard origin/<base>` on a branch whose commits exist only
  locally can lose them outright. Round 2 rule for every researcher with write access.

## A-42. **PROVENANCE CORRECTION TO A-28 — the template is NOT a new obstruction** **[V, compiled]**

- **found-by:** `infra-scaffold-crnt` (PR #12), correcting its own earlier claim after a peer.
- `PersistentOrbit.omegaLimit_positive` (`GlobalPersistence.lean:161`) **already proved the universal
  form by the same argument.** `universalPositive_omegaLimit_of_closedPositiveConfine` is not a new
  obstruction discovered this round; **what is new is only that the floor is not needed.**
- **Do not cite the template as a fresh result.** Cite `GlobalPersistence.lean:161` for the
  obstruction, and the template only for the strengthening. This is exactly the A-36 problem — a
  pre-existing theorem re-authored as new.

## A-43. **SCOPE — closed positive confines EXIST and are built throughout the tree** **[V, compiled]**

- **found-by:** same. The template **discharges**; it is not an impossibility result. Closed positive
  confines are constructed all over the tree — **including by the GAC chain itself**:
  `CRNT/Dynamics/GACNoCriticalSiphon.lean:158` **derives the universal form**.
- **The contradiction requires the caller to ALSO supply a boundary ω-point** (`hwmax`/`hzeroMax`/
  `hPmaxne`). A network with no boundary ω-point satisfies the template's hypotheses happily.
- So `complexBalanced_genuinePermanent`'s **no-critical-siphon branch is sound and unaffected**; it
  is only the *boundary* case — the branch `HighCodimensionSiphonFace` exists for — that is
  incompatible with a closed positive confine. **This is the sharpest statement of what Hole A
  needs: not a permanence certificate, but one that tolerates a boundary ω-point while still
  exhibiting an interior one.**
- Confines A-31: the template does **not** retire the `hsep` family; that is a different hypothesis
  shape, killed by `form-barrier`'s separate barrier-free floor-along-orbit lemma. Cite both.

## A-44. The comment at `HighCodimensionSiphonFace.lean:1493` was **false and load-bearing** **[V]**

- **found-by:** `adv-audit.DriftA`, corrected by `infra-scaffold-crnt` (comment-only change).
- It claimed a **non-convex** upper region escapes the segment argument. **False.** That single
  sentence split two researchers to opposite verdicts for **two rounds** and cost the swarm real
  budget. It is now corrected in place.
- **Lesson, and it is the round's second instance of the same shape as A-39:** a *false comment* in a
  load-bearing file propagates exactly like a false broadcast, and neither is caught by any gate.
  `research/README.md` §8 covers broadcasts; **comments in `CRNT/` deserve the same scrutiny**, and
  in particular a comment that *justifies* an omission is the highest-risk text in the tree.

## A-45. `Concentration S` is `S → ℝ` — **plain reals, not `ℝ≥0`** **[V, verified]**

- **found-by:** `adv-refute`, PR #6; verified by the orchestrator at
  `CRNT/Kinetics/Concentration.lean:19` — `abbrev Concentration (S : Type) := S → ℝ`.
  `Nonnegative` is `∀ s, 0 ≤ x s` (:23) and `Positive` is `∀ s, 0 < x s` (:26), both pointwise.
- **I had assumed `ℝ≥0`.** It matters: the ambient type is unconstrained reals, so the
  nonnegativity hypothesis is a *separate, real* condition (`hωnn`, `hΓpos`, `hx₀`), not baked into
  the type. Anyone reasoning about where a nonnegativity constraint comes from must not assume the
  ambient type supplies it.

## A-46. **Hole A is not vacuous — it is genuinely the GAC** **[V]**

- **found-by:** `adv-refute`, from the pre-existing `CRNT/Examples/CodimTwoFaceModel.lean`.
- The hypothesis set is **satisfiable**: every hypothesis except `hsol` holds with a **false
  conclusion**. So the hole is not vacuously true, not trivially dischargeable, and not malformed.
- **It is a faithful statement of the Global Attractor Conjecture in the boundary case.** Combined
  with **A-40** (not refutable; exhaustive first-order search finds nothing), the verdict on Hole A
  is now complete and positive:
  * **not vacuous** (A-46) — the hypotheses are jointly satisfiable;
  * **not refutable** (A-40) — exhaustive search over first-order networks, 2–4 species,
    ≤ 4 ordered reactions, exact arithmetic: `hits=0`;
  * **no formulation gap** — `projOn`'s weakness makes `hcodim` *stricter* than classical;
  * **genuinely open**, and its residue is one unproved dynamical estimate the tree proves equivalent
    to the goal (A-23, A-37).
- **This is a better position than round 1 started from.** The round proved the *packaging* dead and
  the *statement* alive, which is the correct split and is now recorded on both sides.

## OPS-2. **`Scaffold/` is GITIGNORED — modules must go under `CRNT/Scaffold/`** **[V]**

- **found-by:** `form-tiles` (PR #15). Several round-1 researchers were told to put modules "under
  `Scaffold/Geometry/`". **A file there is in no build target at all** and does not reach any PR
  reviewer's compiler. `Scaffold/` at the repository root is ignored by `.gitignore`.
- **`CRNT/Scaffold/` is the correct location.** Added to the round-2 brief for every researcher.

## B-24. **The `RRGluable` INSTANCE is the blocker — no privacy lift is needed** **[V, three sources agree]**

- **found-by:** `form-sr-parity` (PR #17), `form-sr-deg2b` (PR #9), `form-sr-case2` (PR #10),
  independently and consistently. **I had this wrong twice in briefs** (B-14 said `glueArc` *was*
  the arc builder; B-16 said the blocker was `prepend` being private). Both wrong.
- **Correct:** `glueArc` (`TrueSRParityRR.lean:388`), `gluable_of_RRGluable` (`:442`) and
  `rrGluedCycle` (`:518`) are **all public and already exported**. `glueArc X Y h` takes
  `h : RRGluable X Y` **as an input**, so the terminal artefact
  `exists_second_evenCycle_of_offCycle_escape` needs **`rr_gluable_arcs`** — the `TrueSRPathRR`
  counterpart of `ss_gluable_arcs` (`TrueSRSpeciesPath.lean:902`) — **not the path data.**
- **`prepend`'s `private` is irrelevant.** It is called internally by `glueArc`, which is legal.
  **No privacy change should be made.**
- Round 1's real primitive blocker — **nothing in the tree had ever built a `TrueSRPathRR`** — is
  fixed by `TrueSRCycle.reactionArcFrom` (PR #10), bounded `k + 1 < n` because the natural `k < n`
  statement is **FALSE** at `k = n−1`.
- **Index-range arithmetic is done**: `fwd_idx_le`, `bwd_idx_ge`, `fwd_bwd_index_split` (PR #9).

## B-25. **`hSR.2` is VACUOUS on a degree-two cycle** **[V, compiled]**

- **found-by:** `form-sr-deg2b` (PR #9). `TrueSRCycle.no_sToRIntersection_of_degree_two'` takes
  **no hypotheses at all** — it is never invoked and cannot be the step producing a contradiction.
- **Consequence:** **degree-two isolation CANNOT be discharged by `hSR.2`**; it must go through
  `hSR.1` plus the strict-gain argument. This is a stronger statement than B-4.
- Their `false_of_shared_sToR_of_trueSRCriterion` is the **only** place `hSR.2` appears in the whole
  development.

## VAC-1. **`DifferentialInclusion.Field` is vacuous when empty — all four barrier conclusions are free** **[V, compiled]**

- **found-by:** `adv-vacuity` (PR #16). `DifferentialInclusion.Field E := E → Set E`
  (`CRNT/Dynamics/DifferentialInclusion.lean:43`) carries **no nonemptiness requirement**.
  `forwardInvariant_vacuous_for_empty_field` proves `ForwardInvariant (fun _ => ∅) R` for every `R`.
- **Blast radius:** all four `ForwardInvariant` conclusions of `PolyhedralBarrier`
  (`forwardInvariant_barrierSublevel` :317, `forwardInvariant_of_cone_descent` :341,
  `forwardInvariant_of_polar_descent` :364, `forwardInvariant_minMaxSublevel` :491).
  **A blueprint that builds a toric field without proving `∀ y, (F y).Nonempty` proves nothing.**
  Not guarded anywhere downstream.
- Related: `hpolar` in `forwardInvariant_of_cone_descent` is vacuous for an empty cone family —
  `hmem`, not `hpolar`, carries the geometry. Same shape as A-25 (`hm` satisfied by `m := 0`).

## B-26. **HOLE B HAS NO WITNESS** **[V]**

- **found-by:** `adv-vacuity` (PR #16). No network in the tree satisfies all three of
  `stronglyConcordant_fullyOpen_of_trueSRCriterion`'s hypotheses (`hsep ∧ hflow ∧ hSR`).
  Repo-wide there are exactly two `TrueSRStrongCriterion` witnesses: `flowN`
  (`CRNT/Examples/TrueSRCounterexample.lean:5`) satisfies `hSR` only **vacuously** (its true-SR graph
  has no edges; `flowN_no_cycle : ∀ C, False`) and fails `hflow`; `netN`
  (`CRNT/Examples/TrueSRNetCoeffCounterexample.lean:33`) has real content but fails `hsep`.
- **So the ear, which must close in `hSR.2`, is currently being built for a class with no known
  member.** Candidate worked out in `research/routes/vacuity-report.md` §R4: the directed 3-cycle
  `A → B → C → A` over `S = Fin 3`. **Build the witness before finishing the ear** — otherwise the
  theorem is about the empty class.
## A-47. **THE FAN ROUTE IS CLOSED. Do not re-open it a fourth time.** **[V, source-read]**

- **found-by:** `FormBarrier-2` · **round 2** · **revive-when:** never for the descent; the fan is
  real, proved, correctly instantiable, and simply concludes the wrong kind of statement.
- **Question asked:** A-35 left open — *can the descent use `ComplexBalanceStoichFan` (20 decls) and
  `ComplexBalanceStoichFanInclusion` (38 decls)?* **Answer: no.** Full report, with all 151 unused
  modules tabulated, in `research/routes/unused-mining.md` on `research/FormBarrier-2`.
- **Reason 1 — wrong conclusion shape.** `grep -in "siphon\|omega\|ZeroSet"` over **both** fan files
  returns **zero matches**. Neither file mentions a siphon, an ω-limit set, a zero set, or a
  cardinality. `ComparableGrowthDescent.descend`'s right disjunct is
  `∃ Q : Finset S, Q.Nonempty ∧ N.IsCriticalSiphon Q ∧ Q.card < P.card ∧ N.SiphonCarried ϕ x₀ Q`
  (`CRNT/Dynamics/SiphonDimensionDescent.lean:128-131`). These are velocity-field theorems.
- **Reason 2 — the live consumer ends in a dead criterion.** The fan is *not* unused in the tree
  (A-30 confirmed by my own reading): `HighCodimensionSiphonFace.lean:3` imports
  `ToricBarrierTrapping`, which uses `N.relativeSourceOrderNegativeStoichFan` at `:137, 184, 237,
  288, 331, 448, 487`. But every ω-limit conclusion in that module is one of three packaged criteria
  carrying `hsep` (`:334, :451, :490`) — the family killed by A-26/A-31.
- **A-35 is CORRECT and should not be re-litigated:** `genuineOrbit_pos`
  (`CRNT/Dynamics/GenuineConfinement.lean:53-56`) plus `hxs`, `hcb`, `0 < δ` supplies everything
  `massActionVectorField_mem_toricField_relativeSourceOrderNegativeStoichFan`
  (`ComplexBalanceStoichFanInclusion.lean:373`) needs, **and the hole file already writes that
  instantiation at `HighCodimensionSiphonFace.lean:761, 972, 1568, 1618`.** The fan route fails on
  *conclusions*, not on inputs.
- **Correction to F-5, for that theorem only:** the selector's `δ` is **not** a blocker. Its proof
  discharges `hnear` from `Metric.infDist_zero_of_mem` plus `hδ`
  (`ComplexBalanceStoichFanInclusion.lean:345-349`), so **any** `δ > 0` instantiates it. `δ` bites
  *downstream* — `toricField_mono_delta` (`CRNT/Geometry/ToricFan.lean:86-88`) makes a large `δ` give
  a larger, weaker field, so a vacuous `δ` yields a vacuous inclusion (cf. VAC-1).
- **Why this matters:** a table reading "58 declarations, no consumer" caused twelve round-1
  researchers to be dispatched to rebuild the fan. The accurate statement is the reverse: **the fan
  is fully wired and fully supplied, and is still the wrong tool.**

## A-48. **THE DESCENT'S ANALYTIC VEHICLE EXISTS AND IS COMPLETE — ONLY THE COMPARISON IS MISSING** **[V, source-read]**

- **found-by:** `FormBarrier-2` · **round 2** · **revive-when:** someone finds a face-indexed Lyapunov
  family whose growth constants are ordered *in the direction the descent needs*.
- `Network.faceSum_field_le` (`CRNT/Dynamics/PersistenceConfined.lean:78-81`) gives, for **any**
  siphon `P` and on any box, `∑_{s∈P} ẋ s ≤ C_P · faceSum P x` with an explicit `C_P`. Feed `V =
  faceSum Pmax`, `L = C_Pmax` into `siphonFace_forwardInvariant`
  (`CRNT/Dynamics/PersistenceTheorem.lean:137-143`, whose `hdiss` clause is exactly
  `deriv (faceSum P (γ u)) t ≤ L · faceSum P (γ t)`), then close the scalar comparison with
  `le_mul_exp_of_forward_deriv_le` (`CRNT/Equilibria/ComplexBalanceLinearStability.lean:821-824`).
  All three are in Hole A's closure. The Grönwall lemmas are hypothesis-free in `V, V'` and accept
  any Lyapunov family. **The analytic vehicle is complete.**
- **The exact gap, visible in the constant:** `C_P = ∑ r κ.k r · (max 1 B)^(deg r) · |∑_{s∈P} ν_r s|`
  is **monotone increasing in `|P|`**. So for `Q ⊊ P` one gets `C_Q ≤ C_P` — the *wrong* direction: a
  smaller face grows **slower**. **No theorem in the tree relates `C_Q` to `C_P`, and none compares
  `faceSum Pmax` with `faceSum Q` across faces.** That single missing comparison is the content of
  `SiphonDimensionDescent.lean:116-123` ("comparing the growth of the relative-entropy Lyapunov
  family across an escape from the face"). `faceSum_field_le` is an **upper** bound; the descent
  needs a **sign**.
- The box bound `(∀ s, x s ≤ B)` is **not** an extra input at the hole: it comes from `hK`/`hmaps`
  by the argument `genuineOrbit_pos` already runs (`GenuineConfinement.lean:63-76`).
- Related: `exists_minimalCriticalSiphon_subset` (`CRNT/Dynamics/SiphonAutocatalysis.lean:599-601`,
  the `R.card < Q.card` step at `:626`) is the **only** cardinality-decreasing critical-siphon
  statement in the tree. It misses `descend` by **exactly one field**: it gives
  `IsMinimalCriticalSiphon Q`, which carries no `SiphonCarried ϕ x₀ Q`. Do not re-derive the finite
  combinatorics; producing the carrier witness is the whole problem.

## A-49. **CONSERVATION LAWS CANNOT DISTINGUISH `Pmax` — the route is dead with a proof** **[V, source-read]**

- **found-by:** `FormBarrier-2` · **round 2** · **revive-when:** never.
- `Network.not_critical_conserved_along_solution` (`CRNT/Dynamics/ConservationLaw.lean:78-85`) is
  attractive — "a conserved quantity pins the siphon" — and it is **unusable at Hole A** because its
  premise is `¬ N.IsCriticalSiphon P`, while the hole's `Pmax` **is** critical
  (`isCriticalSiphon_zeroSet_of_mem_omegaLimit`, `CRNT/Dynamics/CriticalSiphonOmega.lean:45`).
- Sharper, and the reason it is not merely "premise unsatisfied": at Hole A the conservation laws live
  in `orthSum N.stoichSubspace` and are constant across the compatibility class, so they are **equal on
  every ω-point**. They therefore carry **zero** information distinguishing `Pmax` from any other
  ω-point's zero set. This is A-40 in structural form, with the sign made explicit.
- Do not reach for `ConservationLaw.lean` or `SiphonConservation.lean` on the strength of their
  statement. `eq_zero_on_pmax_of_conservation_eq` (`HighCodimensionSiphonFace.lean:569`) is the
  in-tree formalisation of why this fails, and its own docstring (`:529-534`) records the obstruction.

## TRAP-4. **THE KINETIC-KERNEL MODULES ARE ABOUT THE COMPLEX SPACE, NOT `Concentration S`** **[V, two sources, disjoint scopes]**

- **found-by:** `FormBarrier-2.LinearMinescout` and `FormBarrier-2.EquilMinescout`, independently,
  on disjoint module sets. **Two scouts, disjoint scopes, same ruling.**
- `CRNT/Deficiency/{ClosedSetKernel, Consistent, ConsistentWR, Drainage, KineticBlock, PerClassKernel,
  SignedDrainage, SteadyStateKernel, TerminalKernelBound, TerminalKernelDimension, TerminalReachable,
  TerminalSLC, TerminalSLCKernel}` state their "support is contained in a set" conclusions about
  `b : N.ComplexIdx → ℝ` **on the complex space**. The concentration space is `Concentration S = S → ℝ`
  (A-45). **These statements do not fit `hmaxExact` / `Pmax`, however much the wording resembles it.**
  All thirteen are in Hole A's closure and all thirteen are among the 151 "unused" modules.

## TRAP-5. **`CRNT.Geometry` NEVER QUANTIFIES OVER `omegaLimit`** **[V, source-read]**

- **found-by:** `FormBarrier-2.GeoMinescout`; confirmed by my own read of `FanFaceLattice.lean`,
  `ToricFan.lean`, `PolyhedralFan.lean`, `FanRefinement.lean`, `ZeroSeparatingInduction.lean`.
- A grep for `omegaLimit` over the entire `CRNT/Geometry/` directory returns **no matches**. No
  geometry module can produce a carried siphon, so **no amount of fan, tiling, δ-core or
  zero-separating machinery closes the descent on its own.** The descent's right disjunct is a
  statement about `Finset S` cardinality, which lives entirely in `CRNT/Dynamics`.
- Corollary for anyone budgeting: the 18 geometry modules in the 151 are the *least* likely of any
  band to bear on Hole A's residue, notwithstanding that they are the largest.

## A-50. **CORRECTION TO MY OWN BROADCAST ITEM 3 — the `projOn` / `forgetLastCoordinate` bridge does not bind** **[V, source-read]**

- **found-by:** `FormBarrier-2` · **round 2** · **revive-when:** someone chooses an ordering of `S`.
- I broadcast (as `[H]`) that nothing bridges the hole's `projOn Pmax` to
  `ProjectedFaceDimensionCode`'s coordinate-deletion projections. **The bridge cannot exist as
  stated.** `projOn` is an **endomorphism** on a fixed species space; `forgetLastCoordinate` maps
  `(Fin (n+1) → ℝ) →ₗ[ℝ] (Fin n → ℝ)` — **two different ambient dimensions**. Matching them needs an
  isomorphism `S ≃ Fin (n+1)`, i.e. an ordering of the species, and `Pmax : Finset S` is unordered.
  Its working theorem `finrank_map_forgetLastCoordinate_bounds` is a two-sided *inequality*, so even
  with an ordering it would not transfer `hcodim` exactly.
- **Moot in any case:** `hcodim`'s entire documented use is `hcodim → {hcard, hrank}`, discharged
  inside the hole file. **Do not build anything that assumes the two projections are connected.**

## OPS-3. **A GREP THAT FINDS NOTHING CAN BE A FALSE NEGATIVE — verify the lemma's actual name** **[V, self-inflicted, corrected in the same session]**

- **found-by:** `FormBarrier-2` · **round 2** · **revive-when:** never.
- Mid-analysis I ran `grep -rn "pos_of_massAction\|forward_positivity\|positivity_of_massAction" CRNT/`,
  got nothing, and was about to report "**no theorem in `CRNT/` proves forward positivity of a
  mass-action solution**" as a third independent killer of the fan route. **The theorem exists**, named
  `Network.genuineOrbit_pos` (`CRNT/Dynamics/GenuineConfinement.lean:53-56`) — a name my pattern
  could not match, and one I had already seen cited elsewhere in the tree without connecting it.
- **The rule:** a negative grep result is evidence about *the pattern you searched*, never about the
  *property*. Before filing any "no such theorem exists" claim, search the **property** by a second
  route — the module's docstring, `grep` on the conclusion's head symbol, or the declaration list.
  A-6 is the same failure at document scale; this is the same failure at grep scale, and it nearly
  produced a false headline in a route document.
