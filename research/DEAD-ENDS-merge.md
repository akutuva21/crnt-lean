# `DEAD-ENDS.md` merge — the two-ledger crosswalk

**This file is generated.** Do not hand-edit it. Regenerate with

```sh
python3 research/scripts/gen_deadends_merge.py
```

It is a *crosswalk*, not a resolution. It says, for every entry on either side, what the
other side says about it and what has to happen to it — and it does **not** pick a winner.
Choosing which file is canonical is the human's merge (nobody may merge a PR; see
`research/README.md` §3).

## Sources

| | branch | entries parsed | grading | character |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **H** | `origin/holes` | 103 heading-entries (102 distinct ids) | `[V]` / `[H]` | orchestrator ledger, appended as broadcasts landed; chronological, uncorrected |
| **P** | `origin/research/adv-negative` (PR #13) | 105 heading-entries (105 distinct ids) | `[M]` / `[S]` / `[N]` | deduplicated across five prior handoff documents; has §0 grading, §4 maintenance protocol and `research/routes/negative-checklist.md` |

Line numbers below are **1-based line numbers in the file at that ref**, not in any working
tree, so they stay checkable after either branch moves.

## Why this cannot be a last-writer-wins

| | count |
| --- | --- |
| entries parsed on `holes` only | **75** |
| entries parsed on PR #13 only | **78** |
| entries whose id appears on **both** sides | 27 |
| of those, byte-identical text (keep one copy) | 26 |
| of those, same finding under a *different* id (keep both ids, one text) | 11 |
| of those, the two sides make **different claims** (keep both, dated) | 1 |
| `holes`-only entries that must be **ported** | **64** |

A silent last-writer-wins drops 64 entries that exist nowhere on PR #13, including the
entire round-2 wave (`A-29`…`A-46`, `B-19`…`B-28`) and every API/OPS/ENV/VAC note.

## ⚠️ Two id hazards that a mechanical merge would hit

**Hazard 1 — the two schemes use the same numerals for different entries.** PR #13 §1/§2
number `A1`…`A30` and `B1`…`B18` *without* a hyphen, while §3b–§3d import the round-1
`A-1`…`A-15` / `B-1`…`B-12` *with* one. Normalising `A-16` and `A16` to the same key
matches unrelated findings:

| `holes` id | what it says | PR #13 id | what it says | title similarity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `A-1` (13) | The `oneBit*` fan-face recursors prove the wrong statement | `A1` (52) | The three packaged barrier criteria cannot be instantiated: any `hsep` instant | 0.0 |
| `A-2` (30) | `binaryWordValue` is the wrong termination measure | `A2` (73) | The theorem's own conclusion is incompatible with `PersistentFrom` — the hole  | 0.0 |
| `A-3` (40) | §7.3 is not open — do not re-attack | `A3` (94) | A globally homogeneous convex polyhedral barrier (max-of-affine) is impossible | 0.0 |
| `A-4` (50) | The ε̃ scale system (Craciun eq. 19) is not open — do not re-attack | `A4` (115) | Anderson–Shiu quadratic face mass is not monotone at codimension ≥ 2 | 0.0 |
| `A-5` (61) | `Refines` is set-containment, not face-to-face equality | `A5` (135) | `hMclass` (bounded positive compatibility class) is not derivable — false off  | 0.0 |
| `A-6` (70) | "IsCompletePointedPolyhedralFan does not exist" — RETRACTED, the entry was WRO | `A6` (152) | The vacuous tile definition: `activeFaceImage` over all positive `x` makes `hm | 0.0 |
| `A-11` (87) | `CraciunZSH.hinterior` is not the paper's hypothesis, and the difference is fa | `A11` (263) | One piece per species is not enough — pieces must be indexed by scale ordering | 0.0 |
| `A-12` (100) | Lemma 9.7 has no quantitative bound on normal straying | `A12` (282) | The topological (two-closed-sets) method cannot fire on branch (I): a species  | 0.0 |
| `A-13` (109) | The n-dimensional upgrade of Lemma 9.7 is not in the paper | `A13` (301) | Descent-iteration route bottoms out at the goal itself | 0.0 |
| `A-14` (116) | The width-≥δ flatness claim needs a qualification the repo omits | `A14` (319) | `hface` of `uniformLowerBound_offFace_of_zeroSet_eq` does not cover the tie br | 0.0 |
| `A-15` (124) | Craciun v3 §7/§9 is reachable only via alphaxiv | `A15` (336) | Branch (4) (exact ties) is dead — ties cannot coexist with face points | 0.0 |
| `B-11` (132) | The `TrueSREarCase2.lean` port cannot be a file copy | `B11` (812) | `ConcordantWith (twoWayInfluenceSpecification) ↔ StronglyConcordant` was demot | 0.0 |

(of 48 hyphen-stripped id pairs, 48 have title similarity below 0.45, i.e. they are
**not** the same finding.) **Merge on content, never on id.**

**Hazard 2 — PR #13 reuses its own ids.** Its §3c numbering (`F-1`…`F-4`, the framing
revision) and its §3g numbering (`F-1`…`F-5`, the fork resolution) are different entries
with the same ids, at lines 1319–1364 and 1820–1870 respectively. Anyone citing "F-1"
without a line number is ambiguous. This table cites line numbers throughout for that
reason.

**Hazard 3 — `holes` itself has a duplicate id.** `A-40` is used twice, at lines 873 and
992, for two unrelated findings ("a strictly positive conservation law separates two class
points is FALSE" and "hole A's statement is NOT refutable"). Both must be ported and
renumbered on the way in.

Duplicate ids on `holes`: `A-40` ×2.

## The crosswalk

`H` column = `holes` id and line. `P` column = PR #13 id and line, or `—` for none.

Plus, on PR #13 and **not** an entry: §0 (grading table), the deduplication note, the ID
mapping table at §3b, `research/routes/negative-checklist.md`, and §4 (maintenance
protocol, six subsections). Those are structural and must survive any merge — they are the
reason PR #13's file is worth more than `holes`'s as an *artifact*, independent of which
entries win.

## Non-entry sections on `holes`

These are prose blocks, not IDed entries, and a diff-based merge will silently drop them:

* **"The Hole B route that survives round 1"** (line 290) — duplicated verbatim on PR #13
  at line 1289. Both copies are stale in the same way: step 1 says to port
  `TrueSRCycle.SignDirected`, which round 1 landed (`B-27`), and step 2 names
  `ss_three_glued_even_of_two`, the wrong flavour (`B-27`).
* **"Maintenance protocol"** (line 314) — the `[V]`/`[H]` protocol. Superseded in full by
  PR #13 §4, which is longer and grades honestly. Do not keep both.
* **"Durable Tier C work"** (line 615) — four unbuilt Tier C items. PORT; nothing on
  PR #13 carries them.
* **"WIP branch status"** (line 886) — a branch-status note, explicitly *not* a
  contribution. Do not port into the ledger; it belongs in the round's handoff.
* **"RULE (tier-wide, from A-41)"** (line 1021) — a negative result ships with its
  certification method. PORT; it is the sharpest process rule in either file and PR #13's
  P3 is its weaker sibling.

## Cross-reference: `adv-audit` (PR #14)

Three documentation defects `adv-audit` found are *ledger-relevant* and belong in the merged
file rather than only in `research/AUDIT.md`. All three re-verified here this session.

| claim | re-verified | where it belongs after the merge |
| --- | --- | --- |
| three docstrings cite `SrBlocks` / `SrProp510`, which exist nowhere | `grep -rn 'SrBlocks\|SrProp510' --include='*.lean' CRNT` → **3 hits, all prose**, at `TrueChemistrySRCriterion.lean:4016, 4069, 7093`; `grep -E '(theorem|lemma|def|structure|abbrev) (SrBlocks|SrProp510)'` → **0**. Matches PR #13 entry B18 verbatim. | merge with B18; the ledger entry is already right, the *docstrings* are what is broken |
| the Hole B flagship carries an undisclosed third hypothesis `hflow` | `stronglyConcordant_fullyOpen_of_trueSRCriterion` at `TrueChemistrySRCriterion.lean:8003-8006` takes `(hsep) (hflow : N.ZeroComplexReactionsAreFlows) (hSR)`; its docstring at `:7998-8002` names only reactant/product separation. | **this is the merge's most important single fact** — see below |
| `HighCodimensionSiphonFace.lean:73-76` makes a false axiom-hygiene claim | the block at `:73-77` asserts "No other declaration in the tree does"; `grep -rn '^\s*sorry\b' CRNT/` → **2 executable sites** per `measure.py`, one of which is the Hole B file. False. | identical to `holes` **A-24**; port A-24 and let it carry the fix |

### Why `hflow` is the merge's load-bearing fact

Both ledgers describe Hole B's flagship as a two-hypothesis theorem (`hsep ∧ hSR`). It is
three. The third, `hflow`, is the reason `holes` **B-26** ("hole B has no witness") is a
statement about the *class* and not about a derivable side condition: PR #16's `flowN`
counterexample fails `hflow` and PR #16's `netN` fails `hsep`, so **no** network in the
tree satisfies `hsep ∧ hflow ∧ hSR`. Any merged ledger that describes the flagship as
`hsep ∧ hSR` will send the next researcher at a vacuous class without saying so.

Cross-referenced entries: `holes` **B-26** (PORT), **B-24** (`rr_gluable_arcs` — built for
the empty class, so it is vacuity-*safe*), **B-27**/**B-28** (arc builder, likewise), and
PR #13 **B17** (the superseded not-built claim) + **B18** (the phantom docstring names).

## Numbers in this file, and how to re-derive them

Everything below is emitted by the generator from `research/scripts/measure.py --no-gates`, so no count here is a hand-typed claim.

| metric | value | source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| executable `sorry`s under `CRNT/` | **2** | `measure.py --no-gates` |
| hole site | `CRNT/Dynamics/HighCodimensionSiphonFace.lean:135` | `measure.py --no-gates` |
| hole site | `CRNT/Multistationarity/TrueChemistrySRCriterion.lean:8607` | `measure.py --no-gates` |
| frontier modules | 844 | `measure.py --no-gates` |
| scaffold modules | 24 | `measure.py --no-gates` |
| Lean lines | 137502 | `measure.py --no-gates` |
| declared `axiom`s | 0 | `measure.py --no-gates` |

The two `hole_sites` are the frozen objective (`holes = 0`). They are listed here so a
reader of this file can see that the merge concerns the *record*, not the target.

## Recommended order of operations (for the human merge)

1. Take PR #13's `DEAD-ENDS.md` as the **base** — grading scheme, deduplication, §4
   protocol and `negative-checklist.md` are structural and exist nowhere else. This is a
   recommendation about *structure*, not about any entry; no entry is thereby resolved.
2. Port the **PORT** rows above, keeping their ids. **Renumber `A-40` (×2) on the way in**
   and preserve the distinction between `A-40a`/`A-40b`.
3. For each **CROSSREF** row, keep PR #13's text and add the `holes` id as an alias in the
   entry's `found-by` line. Do not paste both texts.
4. For **A-6** (the only `DIVERGES` among the round-1 entries): PR #13's §3b A-6 and its
   `P4` bullet 2 assert something `holes` **retracted**. Port the retraction, and delete the
   retracted claim rather than merging the two — a retracted false claim that survives in a
   new file is worse than the original error.
5. Keep `adv-negative`'s §3f (`C-1`…`C-5`) even though the dispute is settled: it is the only
   record of *why* the fork looked contested, and `H-3`'s `closure_minimal` subtlety is
   only legible against it.
6. Do **not** renumber the dashless `A1`…`A30` / `B1`…`B18`. Renumbering makes Hazard 1
   permanent instead of fixable.
