"""Enforce the invariants around the unverified-module ledger.

Six checks.  Checks 1-4 are the original four; 5 and 6 replace a coverage gap in them.

  1. `lakefile.toml`, `CRNTFrontier.lean` and `scripts/frontier_history.txt` are
     exactly what `gen_lakefile.py --check` would produce from the ledger, so
     nobody can quietly exclude a module by editing a generated file.  This is
     read-only; it never repairs the tree.
  2. The ledger has not grown past its recorded baseline.  It may shrink freely.
  3. Every ledger entry names a file that exists on disk (a stale entry hides the
     fact that a module was deleted -- the previous lakefile excluded
     `CRNT.Decision.StrictConeRealization`, which had no file at all).
  4. `CRNT.lean` does not reach any ledger module, transitively.
  5. `CRNT.lean` does not reach any module carrying a `sorry`/`axiom`/`admit` --
     asserted DIRECTLY on the import closure, not as an intersection with the ledger.
  6. Every `CRNT/` module is accounted for: in the ledger, or in the closure, or
     explicitly noted as glob-only.  `Scaffold/` is reported as being in no target.

WHY 5 EXISTS.  Check 4 has been vacuous since the ledger was emptied at c56739b:
`set(ledger) & closure` is `set() & anything` == `set()`, so it cannot fail and its
"ok" line is not evidence.  `adv-audit` found this and measured the coverage gap it
conceals: 846 `CRNT/` modules on disk, 701 in `CRNT.lean`'s closure, ledger 0, so 145
modules are covered by no ledger invariant -- and both holes are among them.  Check 5
states the fact check 4 was standing in for, in a form that stays meaningful when the
ledger is empty.  Check 4 is kept because it goes live the moment a module is listed.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/check_exclusions.py
    python3 scripts/check_exclusions.py --coverage          # full census, exit 0
    python3 scripts/check_exclusions.py --write-baseline
