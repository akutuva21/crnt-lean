# The `analyze` executable

A compiled command-line analyzer: it reads a `NetworkData` (or a JSON array of them) from stdin and
writes the corresponding `Analysis` (or array) as JSON to stdout. Because it runs the *compiled*
`NetworkData.analyze`, it produces structural invariants at native speed with no per-network
elaboration — the throughput path for bulk scoring.

**Trust boundary.** This executable uses compiled evaluation (compiler trust), so it lives outside
the kernel-checked guarantees of the `CRNT` library. The library's `analyze_*_eq` bridges relate each reported
field to its propositional definition; for a kernel-checked certificate of a specific network, use
the codegen contract (`docs/generated-certificates.md`) instead.

Usage:

    echo '{"numSpecies":2,"reactions":[{"source":[1,0],"target":[0,1]},
           {"source":[0,1],"target":[1,0]}]}' | lake exe analyze
