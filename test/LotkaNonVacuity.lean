# Non-vacuity, Lotka witness

Split out of `test/NonVacuity.lean` because `CRNT.Examples.Lotka` is still in the frontier target:
its proofs are written but have never been elaborated. This file is registered in
`scripts/gen_lakefile.py` under `UNVERIFIED_TESTS` and is excluded from `lake test`.

Move these four checks into `test/NonVacuity.lean` and delete the exclusion the moment
`CRNT.Examples.Lotka` builds. They are the strongest negative control available for the exclusion
route: the Lotka network really does have positive periodic orbits (Lotka-Volterra has a first
integral whose positive level sets are closed curves), so a `noPositivePeriodicOrbitCertified` flag
that reported `true` here would be reporting a falsehood, not merely being uninformative.

/-! ## Both exclusion routes fail on the Lotka network

`CRNT/Examples/Lotka.lean` proves that the Lotka network is not weakly reversible and has
stoichiometric rank at least two, so neither compiled exclusion route applies to it. That is the
strongest available negative control for `noPositivePeriodicOrbitCertified`: the network really
does oscillate (Lotka–Volterra has a first integral whose level sets are closed curves), so a flag
that reported `true` here would be reporting a falsehood rather than merely being uninformative.

Not `decide`-based, so it exercises the theorem rather than the Boolean. -/

/-- The conservation identity itself, as a test: at every positive concentration the first integral
of the Lotka system has vanishing derivative along the field. This is the algebraic heart of the
non-vacuity witness, and it is unconditional. -/
