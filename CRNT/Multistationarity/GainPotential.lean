# Feasible multipliers for a gain-weighted digraph

Shinar--Feinberg's Proposition 5.12 needs, for a reaction block of the sign-causality graph with
no stoichiometrically expansive directed cycle, a positive multiplier per species satisfying

    G v w * M w  ≤  M v

on every causal unit `v → w`, where `G v w` is the edge gain.  This is the multiplicative form of
the classical statement that a system of difference constraints is feasible when no cycle has
negative total weight, and the witness is the extremal (shortest-path) solution.

This module proves the finite graph multiplier result in both closed-walk and simple-cycle
forms (`exists_feasible_multipliers` and `exists_feasible_multipliers_of_simple`).  The proof
uses bounded-walk maxima, finite cycle deletion, and factorization of closed walks into simple
cycles.  The remaining work in the CRNT theorem is network-specific: identify the relevant
reaction blocks and transfer the true-SR hypotheses to their causal gains.

Depends on: Mathlib only.

/-- **Stabilization from a shortening property.**

If every walk of length at least `K` can be replaced by a strictly shorter walk of at least the
same gain, the bounded-walk maximum stops growing at `K`, and `gainIter_feasible_of_stable` then
yields feasible multipliers.

This isolates the one remaining ingredient of Proposition 5.12 in general.  The shortening
property is the cycle-deletion argument: a walk with at least `Fintype.card V` steps visits some
vertex twice, so it contains a directed cycle, and when no cycle is stoichiometrically expansive
that cycle has gain at most one and can be excised without decreasing the total. -/

/-- **Proposition 5.12 from the simple-cycle hypothesis.**  This is the form Shinar--Feinberg
state: it is enough that no *simple* directed cycle is stoichiometrically expansive.  Closed
walks factor gain-wise into simple cycles, so the closed-walk hypothesis of
`exists_feasible_multipliers` follows. -/

/-- **Restriction of a strict sum inequality to a subset (Shinar--Feinberg 5.4, Remark 5.6).**

Dropping terms that are nonpositive cannot destroy a strict positivity statement.  This is the
step that takes the global kernel inequality at a species to the inequality restricted to the
reactions of a single sign-causality source: every reaction outside the source, and every term
inside it that is not causal for the species' sign, contributes with the opposing sign. -/
