# The aggregate causal degree of a cycle species is exactly two

At every species vertex of the cycle `C`, the **aggregate class flux** is completely determined.
Under `hSR`, a cycle reaction whose class is not one of the two neighbours of that species has
*zero* flux there (`nonAdjacent_cycleClassFlux_eq_zero`), while the two neighbours have strictly
opposite signs, pinned by the s-cycle's causal orientation `hcausal`/`hopp`.  Concretely, at the
vertex `C.species b`:

* `C.reaction b` has a **strictly negative** product — it is the reaction whose *left* edge meets
  `C.species b`;
* `C.reaction ((finRotate n).symm b)` has a **strictly positive** product — it is the reaction whose
  *right* edge meets `C.species b`;
* every other cycle reaction has product exactly `0`.

So the aggregate causal degree of a cycle species **restricted to cycle classes** is exactly one out
and one in — degree two, with no slack.  This is the formal content of DEAD-ENDS B-5 ("`hopp` /
`hcausal` / `¬hnc` are already sharp"), and it has one sharp consequence for the Hole B residue.

## Why this matters at the residue

At `TrueChemistrySRCriterion.lean:8579` the minimal aggregate causal path `Q0` starts at an
**on-cycle species** `s0` and every later vertex is off the cycle (`hQ0late`).  A causal edge out of
a species vertex requires a strictly negative class flux there, and by the trichotomy below a
*cycle* class can only provide that if it is `C.reaction b` — which **is** a cycle vertex, forbidden
by `hQ0late`.  Hence:

* `negCausalStep_from_cycleSpecies`: **the first hop out of a cycle species lands on
  `C.reaction b`, or on an off-cycle class that drains the cycle species.**  That dichotomy is the
  whole of the residue, and the second alternative is the ear's off-cycle end.

* `no_escape_from_cycleSpecies`: conversely, if no off-cycle class drains any cycle species, the
  residue branch is closed outright (`False`).  The Hole B residue is therefore **equivalent to the
  single named proposition `no_offCycle_negFlux`**.

* `exists_offCycle_negFlux_class`: the positive form — under `¬ no_offCycle_negFlux` the escape
  necessarily produces an off-cycle class `ρ` with a strictly negative class flux at a cycle
  species.  That is the datum DEAD-ENDS B-3 records as missing, in the correctly scoped form
  (`hrest` itself cannot be discharged, B-3).

## Note on `import`

This module **does** import `TrueChemistrySRCriterion` (it needs `trueInternalClassFlux`,
`nonAdjacent_cycleClassFlux_eq_zero`, `TrueInternalAggregateCausalEdge`, `ActiveAggregateTrueReaction`
and `CRNT.RelPath`).  None of the declarations below depends on the `sorry` in that file and none of
the declarations *defined after* it is used; `#print axioms` on each reports only
`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.  (Contrast the A.6 Case-2 port, which must not import it
at all — DEAD-ENDS B-12.)
