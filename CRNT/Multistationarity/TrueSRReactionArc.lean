# Reaction-to-reaction arcs of a cycle

`TrueSRSpeciesPath.lean` builds the **species** flavour of a cycle arc: between species vertex
`0` and species vertex `m`, a cycle is two species-to-species paths (`speciesArc`,
`speciesArcBwd`) with those endpoints and disjoint interiors.  The **reaction** flavour has no
builder on `holes`, and `TrueSRPathRR` — the object Shinar--Feinberg's Lemma A.4 three-path
parity argument consumes, and hence the object
`exists_second_evenCycle_of_offCycle_escape` must produce — cannot be built at all without it.

This file supplies that builder.

## The combinatorial content

A `TrueSRCycle n` carries `leftEdge i : S_i — R_i` and `rightEdge i : R_i — S_{i+1 mod n}`, so the
graph is the chain

```
R_0 — S_1 — R_1 — S_2 — R_2 — … — S_m — R_m
```

**Lemma (uniqueness of the forward route).**  From `R_0` there is exactly one simple route to
`R_m` running forward: `rightEdge 0, leftEdge 1, rightEdge 1, …, rightEdge (m-1), leftEdge m`,
of length `2m`.

*Proof.*  `R_0`'s only neighbours are `S_0` (via `leftEdge 0`) and `S_1` (via `rightEdge 0`); a
path using `S_0` runs *backwards*.  On the forward side `S_i`'s only neighbours are `R_{i-1}`
(`rightEdge (i-1)`) and `R_i` (`leftEdge i`), so from `S_i` the route must take `leftEdge i`.
Induction. ∎

**Parity.**  The true-SR graph is bipartite (species against reactions — `TrueSREdge.Connects`
only ever pairs `Sum.inl` with `Sum.inr`), so every reaction-to-reaction path has even length;
`2m` is even.

`TrueSRPathRR j` records a reaction-to-reaction path of `2j+2` edges as a first edge plus a
`TrueSRPath (2j+1)` tail.  Splitting off `rightEdge 0` gives `j = m - 1`:

* `first = rightEdge 0`, joining `R_0` to `S_1`;
* `tail : TrueSRPath (2 * (m - 1) + 1)` running `S_1 — R_1 — S_2 — … — S_m — R_m`.

`m > 0` is required (a zero-length reaction arc would be a bare reaction vertex) and `m < n` keeps
every species and reaction index inside the cycle.

## Implementation note

The tail's index type is `Fin (2 * (m - 1) + 1)`, which Lean does not defeq-reduce to
`Fin (2 * m - 1)`.  The helper definitions are therefore indexed by `ℕ` with an explicit bound,
and the `Fin` index is recovered at each use site by `omega`.  Indexing by `Fin` directly turns
every bound proof into a normalisation fight.
