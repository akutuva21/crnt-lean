# Minimal example: a single irreversible reaction `A → B`

The smallest nontrivial network. It demonstrates building a `Network`, computing its
complex count, evaluating reaction vectors, and reasoning about (the failure of)
reachability. Being irreversible, it is **not** weakly reversible.

This module is **stable** (example/test). It contains no `sorry`.
