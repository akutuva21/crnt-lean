# The Lotka network: a concrete mass-action system with positive periodic orbits

## Why this file exists

The oscillation development has no network for which `OscillatoryCapacity` is proved. Everything in
it is either an exclusion theorem (no oscillation) or a conditional existence route;
`Examples.HopfNetwork3` reaches a Hurwitz-boundary crossing with transversal eigenvalue motion and
stops there. So no `…Target` in the tree has ever been composed end to end on a real network, which
means a target that is subtly too weak to compose cannot be detected by anything except reading it.
That is not hypothetical: `FloquetOrbitalStabilityTarget` was outright vacuous until it was
strengthened, and reading is what caught it. See `docs/math-review.md`.

This file is the cheapest possible witness in the other direction.

## The network

```
r₀ :  A → 2A          (autocatalytic growth of A)
r₁ :  A + B → 2B      (predation: B consumes A and reproduces)
r₂ :  B → 0           (decay of B)
```

Its mass-action vector field is

```
ẋ = k₀ x − k₁ x y
ẏ = k₁ x y − k₂ y
```

which is exactly the Lotka–Volterra predator–prey system — the standard example of a mass-action
network all of whose positive non-equilibrium orbits are closed. The function

```
V(x, y) = k₁ x + k₁ y − k₂ log x − k₀ log y
```

is a first integral, strictly convex on the open positive quadrant with its unique minimum at the
positive equilibrium `(k₂/k₁, k₀/k₁)`, so its level sets are compact closed curves and every
non-equilibrium positive solution traverses one.

Two reasons this is the right target rather than `HopfNetwork3`:

* the closed orbit comes from a conserved quantity, so the proof needs no centre manifold, no
  normal form and no first Lyapunov coefficient — all of which live in the unverified frontier;
* the network has stoichiometric rank two, the setting the planar route is built for, so proving it
  also exercises `RankTwoPlanar` / `PlanarPoincareBendixson`.

## Indexing choice

`Species` and `Rxn` are `Fin 2` and `Fin 3` rather than custom inductives, unlike the other example
modules. The reason is purely about proof robustness: sums and products over `Fin n` reduce by the
Mathlib simp lemmas `Fin.sum_univ_three` and `Fin.prod_univ_two`, whereas enumerating
`Finset.univ` for a `deriving Fintype` inductive needs a hand-written `Finset.sum_insert` chain.
Readable names are recovered by the abbreviations below.

## What is proved here and what is not

Proved: the network, the explicit form of both components of the vector field, the positive
equilibrium, the conservation identity `⟪∇V, F⟫ = 0` at every positive concentration, failure of
weak reversibility, and rank `≥ 2` (so neither compiled exclusion route applies, as it must not).

Not proved: the step from "V is constant along the orbit" to an actual `PositivePeriodicOrbit`
structure, which needs a period. That is `HasPositivePeriodicOrbitTarget` at the end of the file,
with the four remaining steps and the core theorems that supply each.

/-! ## The first integral

`V(x, y) = k₁ x + k₁ y − k₂ log x − k₀ log y`, with gradient `(k₁ − k₂/x, k₁ − k₀/y)`.

The gradient is written as a separate definition rather than derived, because the only thing needed
downstream is the algebraic identity `⟪∇V, F⟫ = 0`; that `firstIntegralGrad` really is the gradient
of `firstIntegral` is a separate (easy) differentiation, stated as `gradient_isGradient` below. -/

  κ.k prey * x A + κ.k prey * x B
    - κ.k decay * Real.log (x A) - κ.k grow * Real.log (x B)

    Species → ℝ :=
  ![κ.k prey - κ.k decay / x A, κ.k prey - κ.k grow / x B]

/-- **The conservation identity.** At every positive concentration the directional derivative of
the first integral along the mass-action field vanishes.

The computation, with `x = x A`, `y = x B`, `k₀ = k grow`, `k₁ = k prey`, `k₂ = k decay`:

```
(k₁ − k₂/x)(k₀x − k₁xy) + (k₁ − k₀/y)(k₁xy − k₂y)
  = k₀k₁x − k₁²xy − k₀k₂ + k₁k₂y      (first bracket)
  + k₁²xy − k₁k₂y − k₀k₁x + k₀k₂      (second bracket)
  = 0
```

Four cancelling pairs: `k₀k₁x`, `k₁²xy`, `k₀k₂`, `k₁k₂y`. Nothing survives. This exact cancellation
is why the Lotka system is conservative, and it is the only place in the file where the specific
form of the network matters. -/

Mathlib builds carries `RCLike.toInnerProductSpaceReal.toModule` where the goal expects
`Semiring.toModule`, and no amount of `simpa` reconciles the two instance paths. Stated in this

/-! ## What remains

Constancy along solutions, compactness of level sets, and a period. -/

/-- **Step 2.** The first integral is constant along every positive solution.

This is `conservation_identity` plus the chain rule, and it has a proved analogue in the verified
core: `Network.relEntropy_antitone_along_solution` does the same differentiation for the
Horn–Jackson entropy, with `≤ 0` in place of `= 0`. The only difference is that the conclusion here
is constancy rather than monotonicity, so `Antitone` becomes a statement that the derivative of
`t ↦ V (γ t)` vanishes identically. -/
def FirstIntegralConstantTarget : Prop :=
  ∀ (κ : Network.RateConstants N) (γ : ℝ → Concentration Species),
    (∀ t, (γ t).Positive) →
    (∀ t s, HasDerivAt (fun τ => γ τ s) (N.massActionVectorField κ (γ t) s) t) →
    ∀ t, firstIntegral κ (γ t) = firstIntegral κ (γ 0)

/-- **Step 3.** Level sets of the first integral inside the open positive quadrant are compact.

`V` is coercive in both directions: as either coordinate tends to `0` the `−log` term tends to
`+∞`, and as either tends to `∞` the linear term dominates. So every sublevel set is bounded away
from the axes and bounded above, hence its closure is a compact subset of the open quadrant. The
verified core has exactly this argument for the Birch dual objective
(`CRNT.birchDual_coercive`, `CRNT.birchDual_exists_isMinOn`), which is the same
`linear − log` shape. -/
def LevelSetCompactTarget : Prop :=
  ∀ (κ : Network.RateConstants N), 0 < κ.k grow → 0 < κ.k prey → 0 < κ.k decay →
    ∀ c : ℝ, IsCompact {x : Concentration Species | x.Positive ∧ firstIntegral κ x ≤ c}

/-- **Step 4, and the goal.** Every positive non-equilibrium solution is periodic, so the Lotka
network has a positive periodic orbit at every choice of positive rates.

Given steps 2 and 3 the orbit is confined to a compact level set on which the field does not
vanish, and the level set is a regular closed curve. The period comes from a transversal return:
take a transversal at a non-equilibrium point of the level set and use the crossing time. The
verified core supplies exactly that — `CRNT/Dynamics/TransversalCrossingTime.lean` and
`CRNT/Dynamics/PoincareReturnMap.lean`, with `TransversalSection.crossingTime` and
`TransversalSection.isPeriodic_returnMap_fixedPoint`. Note this needs only the transversal-return
part of the planar theory, not Poincaré–Bendixson, so it does not depend on the frontier. -/
def HasPositivePeriodicOrbitTarget : Prop :=
  ∀ κ : Network.RateConstants N,
    0 < κ.k grow → 0 < κ.k prey → 0 < κ.k decay → N.HasPositivePeriodicOrbit κ

/-- **The non-vacuity witness, conditional on step 4.** Once `HasPositivePeriodicOrbitTarget` is
discharged for a single positive rate vector, the Lotka network witnesses `OscillatoryCapacity` and
the oscillation development has its first end-to-end existence result on a concrete network. -/
