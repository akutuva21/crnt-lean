# A concrete reversible pair against the embedded-jump convergence interface

The geometric-convergence theorems on the embedded jump chain of a reaction network
(`CRNT.Stochastic.RegionStronglyConnected`, `CRNT.Stochastic.CountWitnessPath`) take a finite
`ClosedEnabledRegion` together with an *aperiodicity self-loop*: a region count `n` and a reaction
`r` that both **holds** (`jumpNextCount n r = n`) and has **positive jump probability**
(`0 < jumpProb κ n r`). This module instantiates that interface on the smallest weakly reversible
network, the reversible pair `A ⇌ B`, and records exactly where a fully hypothesis-discharged,
unconditional convergence instance meets the count lattice.

## The reversible pair

`A ⇌ B` has species `{A, B}`, complexes `A = (1,0)` and `B = (0,1)`, and the two reactions
`fwd : A → B`, `bwd : B → A`. It is weakly reversible (`weaklyReversible`). On the count lattice the
firings are the truncated shifts `jumpNextCount n fwd = (n_A − 1, n_B + 1)` and
`jumpNextCount n bwd = (n_A + 1, n_B − 1)`; mass `n_A + n_B` is conserved on enabled firings.

## Two structural obstructions to an unconditional instance

The convergence interface, as it stands, cannot be fired unconditionally on this (or any genuine)
network, for two independent reasons proved here.

* **No aperiodicity self-loop.** A reaction with positive jump probability is enabled
  (`stochasticMassActionRate` forces every falling factorial positive, i.e. `source ≤ n`), so its
  firing is the exact untruncated shift `n − source + target`; that equals `n` only when
  `target = source`, impossible for a reaction between distinct complexes. The aperiodicity
  hypothesis `jumpNextCount n r = n ∧ 0 < jumpProb κ n r` is therefore unsatisfiable for *every*
  network whose reactions have distinct source and target complexes — recorded generically as
  `no_aperiodic_self_loop` and specialized to the pair as `pair_no_aperiodic_self_loop`. The
  finite-state Perron–Frobenius argument supplies aperiodicity through such a holding
  self-loop, which the mass-action jump chain on `S → ℕ` never has.

* **No finite closed enabled region.** A `ClosedEnabledRegion` demands every reaction enabled at
  every member (`enabled`) and the post-firing count to stay inside (`forward`). For `A ⇌ B`,
  `enabled` forces `1 ≤ n_A` and `1 ≤ n_B` at every member, yet firing `fwd` from a member with
  `n_A = 1` lands on `n_A = 0`, which `forward` requires to be a member too — contradicting
  `enabled`. So a closed enabled region of the pair contains no count with `n_A = 1`: the simplex
  boundary, where the `A → B` propensity vanishes, breaks closure. Recorded as `pair_not_closed_of_mem`.

These are the structural facts a non-vacuity witness must confront: the embedded-jump convergence
theorems are sound but their finite-region-plus-self-loop hypotheses are jointly unsatisfiable on the
genuine count lattice of a mass-action network. The picture is Anderson, Craciun & Kurtz,
"Product-form stationary distributions for deficiency zero chemical reaction networks": the recurrent
class of the embedded chain is a single positive-recurrent communicating class, but on `S → ℕ` it is
infinite (a full conservation class with no boundary-free interior) and aperiodic only through the
truncated boundary dynamics, neither of which the finite-state holding-self-loop interface of Norris,
"Markov Chains", §1.8 captures.

## Main results

* `N` — the reversible pair `A ⇌ B` as a `Network`.
* `weaklyReversible` — the network is weakly reversible.
* `enabled_of_jumpProb_pos` — a positive-probability reaction is enabled.
* `no_aperiodic_self_loop` — for any network with all source ≠ target, no count carries a
  positive-probability holding reaction.
* `pair_no_aperiodic_self_loop` — the aperiodicity hypothesis of the convergence theorems is
  unsatisfiable for the pair.
* `pair_not_closed_of_mem` — a closed enabled region of the pair contains no count with `n_A = 1`,
  so no nonempty conservation window is closed.

This module is **stable** and `sorry`-free. Depends on:
`CRNT.Basic.Network`, `CRNT.Graph.WeakReversibility`, `CRNT.Stochastic.CountWitnessPath`,
`CRNT.Stochastic.RegionStronglyConnected`.

/-- **No aperiodicity self-loop on a network of genuine reactions.** A holding reaction at a count
(`jumpNextCount n r = n`) with positive jump probability is impossible whenever every reaction has
distinct source and target complexes: positive probability makes the firing the untruncated shift
`n − source + target` (`enabled_of_jumpProb_pos`), so `jumpNextCount n r = n` forces `target = source`
species by species, contradicting distinctness. This is the structural obstruction to the aperiodicity
hypothesis of the finite-state convergence theorems
(`jumpStronglyConnected_pow_mulVec_tendsto_stationaryVec` and its complex-shift specialization): the
mass-action embedded jump chain carries no holding self-loop at any enabled count. -/
