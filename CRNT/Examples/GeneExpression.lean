# Simple gene expression

A mechanistic transcription/translation/degradation network:

```text
DNA → DNA + mRNA      (transcription; DNA acts catalytically)
mRNA → mRNA + Protein (translation; mRNA acts catalytically)
mRNA → 0              (mRNA degradation)
Protein → 0           (protein degradation)
```

It demonstrates source/target complexes, the zero complex, and the mass-action vector
field. As a structural (parameter-independent) fact we prove that the DNA concentration
is conserved by the mass-action dynamics: `d[DNA]/dt = 0` for every rate choice and
every concentration, because DNA appears catalytically.

This module is **stable** (example/test). It contains no `sorry`.
