# Global attraction for the reversible pair `A ⇌ B`

A worked instantiation of `gac_of_hasNoCriticalSiphon` on a concrete network. The reversible
pair has no critical siphon — its only nonempty siphon is the full species set `{A, B}`, on
which the total-mass vector `v ≡ 1` is a strictly positive conservation law — so the
no-critical-siphon global-attraction theorem applies to it for every choice of rate
constants. This exhibits a network meeting all hypotheses of the theorem simultaneously.

Depends on:
`CRNT.Examples.ReversiblePair`, `CRNT.Dynamics.Siphon`, `CRNT.Dynamics.GACNoCriticalSiphon`,
`CRNT.Theorems.DeficiencyZero.Existence`, `CRNT.Equilibria.CompatibilityClass`.

/-- Every nonempty siphon of `A ⇌ B` contains both species. The forward reaction produces
`B` and consumes only `A`, and the backward reaction produces `A` and consumes only `B`, so
membership of either species forces the other. -/

/-- **The reversible pair has no critical siphon.** Any nonempty siphon is the full species
set, and the total-mass vector `v ≡ 1` is strictly positive there and orthogonal to every
reaction vector, so it witnesses that no subset is a critical siphon. -/

positive complex-balanced equilibrium whose mass-action orbit converges to it: all
