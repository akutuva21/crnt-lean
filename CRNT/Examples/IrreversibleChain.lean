# Irreversible chain `A → B → C`

A linear, irreversible pathway. It has three species, three complexes, two reactions,
and one linkage class, but is **not** weakly reversible: nothing returns to `A` or `B`
once `C` is reached. This module proves the complex count and the failure of weak
reversibility.
