# The door graph of the N = 2 subdivision, derived from its geometry

`CRNT.Analysis.SpernerGridMulti` realizes the four-cell `N = 2` subdivision as a `MultiDoorIncidence`
but *specifies* its door graph by listing the two door edges. This module instead **derives** the
door graph from the underlying geometry — vertices, a coloring, and triangles given as vertex sets —
discharging the lattice-edge incidence lemma the construction rests on.

## The geometric data

The vertices are the three corners `A, B, C` and three edge midpoints `mAB, mAC, mBC` of the
2-simplex, colored `A = 0, B = 1, C = 2, mAB = 1, mAC = 0, mBC = 2`. Each triangle is its set of
three vertices (`triVerts`):

* `up1 = {A, mAB, mAC}`, `up2 = {mAB, B, mBC}`, `up3 = {mAC, mBC, C}`, `dn = {mAB, mAC, mBC}`.

A `{0,1}`-**door edge** of the triangulation is an unordered pair of vertices, both belonging to a
common triangle, whose colors are `{0, 1}`. The door graph is then defined *geometrically*:

* two distinct triangles are adjacent (`CellAdj`) when they **share** a `{0,1}`-door edge — two
  common vertices `u ≠ v` with `isDoor (colorOf u) (colorOf v)`;
* a triangle is adjacent to a boundary outer vertex (`BoundaryAdj`) when it contains both endpoints
  of that outer vertex's door edge.

No edge list is assumed: `CellAdj` quantifies over the vertices of the triangles, so the adjacency is
computed from `triVerts` and `colorOf` alone.

## The lattice-edge incidence lemma

The two named incidence facts are proved by `decide` directly from `triVerts`:

* `interior_doorEdge_borders_two`: the interior door edge `mAB–mAC` is contained in **exactly two**
  triangles, `up1` and `dn`;
* `boundary_doorEdge_borders_one`: the boundary door edge `A–mAB` is contained in **exactly one**
  triangle, `up1`.

These are precisely "every interior `{0,1}` sub-edge borders exactly two triangles; every boundary
`{0,1}` sub-edge borders exactly one." They are what forces each triangle's geometric door degree to
equal its local door count, discharging `cell_degree`. The whole datum is assembled as a
`MultiDoorIncidence` (`multiDoorIncidence`) whose color triples are read off `colorOf ∘ triV`, and
`exists_rainbow_cell` recovers the central triangle `dn` as the rainbow triangle — the two-dimensional
Sperner conclusion from a door graph built entirely from geometry.

## Main results

* `interior_doorEdge_borders_two`, `boundary_doorEdge_borders_one` — the lattice-edge incidence lemma.
* `multiDoorIncidence` — the geometrically-derived four-cell `MultiDoorIncidence`.
* `exists_rainbow_cell` — it has a rainbow triangle.
