# A concrete multi-triangle multi-outer door-incidence datum

This module constructs a *genuinely multi-triangle* `MultiDoorIncidence` term and runs it through
`CRNT.Analysis.SpernerTriangulation.MultiDoorIncidence.exists_rainbow`, exercising the uncollapsed
door-incidence interface (door graph on `Cell ⊕ Outer`) on a real triangulation with an interior
shared door — the step the single-cell `CRNT.Analysis.SpernerGrid` could not reach.

The triangulation is the **N = 2 barycentric subdivision of the 2-simplex** `ABC`, the canonical
Sperner picture: the three corners `A, B, C`, the three edge midpoints `mAB, mAC, mBC`, and the four
small triangles

* `up1 = {A, mAB, mAC}`, `up2 = {mAB, B, mBC}`, `up3 = {mAC, mBC, C}` (the corner triangles), and
* `dn = {mAB, mAC, mBC}` (the central inverted triangle).

With the standard corner coloring `A = 0`, `B = 1`, `C = 2` and the midpoint choice `mAB = 1`,
`mAC = 0`, `mBC = 2` (each midpoint colored within the Sperner-admissible pair of its side), the
vertex-color triples are

* `up1 ↦ (0, 1, 0)`, door count `2`; `up2 ↦ (1, 1, 2)`, door count `0`;
* `up3 ↦ (0, 2, 2)`, door count `0`; `dn ↦ (1, 0, 2)`, door count `1` — the unique rainbow triangle.

The `{0,1}`-doors of this coloring are exactly two: the **interior** edge `mAB–mAC` shared by `up1`
and `dn`, and the **boundary** edge `A–mAB` of `up1` (on side `AB`). The door graph therefore has one
interior edge `up1 — dn` and one cell–outer edge `up1 — Outer.boundary`; every other triangle has
door degree `0`. The two geometric incidence fields `cell_degree` (each triangle's door degree equals
its local door count: `2, 0, 0, 1`) and `outer_odd` (the lone boundary outer vertex has odd degree)
are discharged by `decide` on this concrete finite door graph.

Feeding the datum to `exists_rainbow` recovers the central triangle `dn` as the rainbow triangle — the
full multi-outer door-incidence pipeline on a genuine four-cell triangulation with a shared interior
door.

## Main results

* `CRNT.Analysis.SpernerN2.multiDoorIncidence` — the concrete four-cell `MultiDoorIncidence`.
* `CRNT.Analysis.SpernerN2.exists_rainbow_cell` — it has a rainbow triangle.

This module is **stable** and `sorry`-free. Depends on:
`Mathlib.Combinatorics.SimpleGraph.Finite`, `Mathlib.Data.Fintype.Sum`,
`Mathlib.Tactic.DeriveFintype`, `CRNT.Analysis.SpernerMultiIncidence`.
