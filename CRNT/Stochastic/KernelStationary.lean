# Predecessor-summation and measure invariance of the embedded jump kernel

This module completes the embedded-jump-chain kernel development by proving the
predecessor-summation lemma the kernel modules name as their honest gap and lifting it to
genuine measure invariance `Kernel.Invariant (jumpKernel κ) (jumpStationaryMeasure κ c)`.

The candidate stationary measure of `CRNT.Stochastic.KernelInvariant` evaluates on
singletons via two exported identities: `jumpStationaryMeasure_singleton` gives
`μ{m} = ofReal (jumpStationaryMass κ c m)`, and `jumpStationaryMeasure_bind_apply`
expands `(μ.bind (jumpKernel κ)) {m}` into a tsum over *source* counts. Equating these two
on every singleton is exactly measure invariance, since singletons generate the discrete
σ-algebra on the count lattice.

The central content is `predecessor_sum_eq`:

`∑' n, ofReal (jumpStationaryMass κ c n) * jumpKernel κ n {m} = ofReal (jumpStationaryMass κ c m)`.

Off the boundary the kernel row mass into `{m}` is
`∑_r ofReal (jumpProb κ n r) · indicator {m} (jumpNextCount n r)`, and
`jumpStationaryMass · jumpProb = productPoissonPMF · stochasticRate = generatorOutflow`
cancels the holding denominator (`ofReal_jumpStationaryMass_mul_jumpProb`). Swapping the
lattice tsum past the finite reaction sum (Tonelli for `ℝ≥0∞`) reduces the problem, reaction
by reaction, to a single predecessor. For a target `m` dominating the reaction's target
complex the unique *source-dominating* predecessor is
`predecessorCount r m = fun s => m s + source_r s - target_r s`; every other count landing on
`m` fails to dominate the source, so its falling-factorial propensity — hence its jump
probability — vanishes. The surviving term is `ofReal (generatorInflow κ c m r)`, and the
reaction-indexed sum collapses by `jumpGlobalBalance_of_complexBalanced`.

The honest hypotheses are an explicit **no-boundary / enabled-everywhere** assumption: every
count has positive exit rate and dominates every reaction's target complex. The
`exitRate = 0` holding states are absorbing, where strict pointwise balance fails, so
invariance is stated under their exclusion — the strongest sound statement. Under those hypotheses
`Kernel.Invariant (jumpKernel κ) (jumpStationaryMeasure κ c)` holds.

This module is **stable** and `sorry`-free. Depends on: `CRNT.Stochastic.KernelInvariant`,
`Mathlib.Data.Nat.Factorial.BigOperators`.

`Kernel.Invariant (jumpKernel κ) (jumpStationaryMeasure κ c)` is by definition
`(jumpStationaryMeasure κ c).bind (jumpKernel κ) = jumpStationaryMeasure κ c`. The two measures
agree on every singleton: the pushforward singleton mass is the predecessor tsum
(`jumpStationaryMeasure_bind_apply`), which the predecessor-summation lemma equates to the
lifted stationary weight, and that is the candidate measure's own singleton mass
(`jumpStationaryMeasure_singleton`). Singletons determine a measure on the countable count
lattice with its discrete σ-algebra (`Measure.ext_of_singleton`), so the measures coincide.
This is the final result of the embedded-chain kernel development. -/
