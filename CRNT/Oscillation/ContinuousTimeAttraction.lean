# Continuous-time attraction from convergent section hits

A contracting Poincare map only controls the discrete sequence of section returns.  Orbital
attraction is a continuous-time statement.  This file isolates and proves the interpolation step:
if successive section states converge to a periodic-orbit base point, every late piece of the
trajectory starts from one of those section states, and finite-time flow segments depend uniformly
on the starting point, then the entire trajectory approaches the geometric periodic orbit.

This is the exact nonlinear bridge needed after `ReturnMapAttraction` / `ScalarReturnStability`.
The remaining Floquet-specific work is therefore to verify the finite-time shadowing hypothesis for
the concrete flow (normally from continuous dependence on initial data on a compact time interval).

/-- Data sufficient to interpolate convergence of discrete Poincare hits into continuous-time
orbital attraction.

`segmentFlow x s` is the finite-time trajectory segment starting from a section state `x`.
`shadow` is uniform continuous dependence on the reference periodic segment for
`0 ≤ s ≤ maxSegment`.  The `tailCover` field says that every sufficiently late time belongs to a
segment starting at a sufficiently late section hit. -/
