# End-to-end ordinary oscillation inheritance for one dependent added reaction

The network algebra for appending a stoichiometrically dependent reaction is closed: the
stoichiometric subspace/rank is unchanged and the new vector field is embedded into a smooth real
parameter family through zero rate.  The return-map IFT and scalar branch-to-periodic-orbit closure
are also closed.

The remaining model-specific construction is therefore a parameterized scalar Poincare section for
the original nondegenerate cycle whose IFT branch stays positive.  Once that object is supplied,
strictly positive added-reaction rate and oscillatory capacity of the enlarged CRN follow
immediately.
