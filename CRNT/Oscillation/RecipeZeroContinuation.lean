# Concrete smooth continuation for parameter-rich Recipe 0

`RecipeZeroCertificate` already contains the complete finite symbolic-Jacobian path: admissible
stable/unstable reactivities, a rank-sized principal block, and nonsingularity of that block on the
whole straight interpolation.  `SupportsSmoothReactivityPaths` realizes the interpolation by one
coherent smooth kinetic family at any chosen positive state.

This file performs that realization explicitly.  The only theorem left after this construction is
the nonlinear global-Hopf implication for the resulting smooth kinetic continuation.
