# The single remaining obligation of the Global Attractor Theorem

`CRNT.Dynamics.GlobalAttractorTheorem` reduces `Network.complexBalanced_genuinePermanent` to
one case, and this module is the only place in the tree where that case is left open.  The
theorem below is the **entire** residual content; everything else in the chain audits as
`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

## What has been carved away

Let `Ω` be the ω-limit set of a bounded genuine positive mass-action trajectory of a
complex-balanced system, and suppose `Ω` meets the boundary.  The dichotomy
`positiveOmega_or_nonstationary_criticalSiphonFaceEquilibrium` produces a boundary point whose
zero set is a critical siphon, and `exists_maximal_zeroSet_omegaPoint` upgrades it to a point
`wmax ∈ Ω` whose zero set `Pmax` is *maximal*: every ω-point vanishing on `Pmax` vanishes
exactly on `Pmax`, no ω-point has a zero set of larger cardinality, i.e. `wmax` sits in the
relative interior of the `Pmax`-face.  Four cases
are then already closed in the tree:

* no critical siphon at all (`boundaryOmegaExcluded_of_hasNoCriticalSiphon`);
* `N.stoichSubspace = ⊥` (`positiveOmegaPointForRates_of_trivialStoichSubspace`);
* `N.stoichRank = 1` (`positiveOmegaPointForRates_of_complexBalanced_of_stoichRank_one`);
* the `Pmax`-face is a **facet** of the compatibility class, where the Anderson--Shiu
  near-facet estimate makes the squared face mass `∑_{s ∈ Pmax} x s ^ 2` nondecreasing and
  `no_omegaLimit_meets_locally_repelling_face` closes the case.

`CRNT.Dynamics.FaceCodimension` then shows the remaining failure of the facet count is never
degenerate: `highCodimension_of_not_facet` yields `2 ≤ finrank (stoichSubspace.map (projOn Pmax))`
and `2 ≤ Pmax.card`.  Those two inequalities are hypotheses below, so the obligation recorded
here is exactly the **codimension ≥ 2** case.

## Why the existing estimate cannot be pushed further

`facet_repelling_near_facet_point` needs every reaction vector restricted to `Pmax` to be a
multiple of one direction `v`, which is precisely
`finrank (stoichSubspace.map (projOn Pmax)) = 1`.  Under `hcodim` the restricted reaction
vectors span at least a plane, and the quadratic `∑_{s ∈ Pmax} x s ^ 2` is then genuinely not
monotone near `wmax`: writing `x s = ε u s` for `s ∈ Pmax`, the leading term of
`∑_{s ∈ Pmax} x s * f s x` is a quadratic form in the approach direction `u ≥ 0` whose sign
varies with `u` — already for a reversible pair inside the face with equal rate constants it is
a negative multiple of a square.  So no strengthening of the Anderson--Shiu argument covers this
branch; a surface whose normal turns with the direction of approach is required.

## The mathematical content that is missing

This is Craciun, *Toric differential inclusions and a proof of the global attractor conjecture*
(v3), Theorem B: a toric differential inclusion admits an exhaustive family of zero-separating
hypersurfaces.  In logarithmic coordinates the requirement (Lemma 9.5, and Lemma 9.7 with the
`δ`-slack) is a hypersurface whose outer normal at a point `X` lies in **every** cone of the fan
within distance `δ` of `X`, hence in low-dimensional cones near the walls.  A smooth surface
cannot satisfy this — the sphere meets the `δ = 0` condition of Lemma 9.5 and fails Lemma 9.7 —
so the surface must be polyhedral, with flat pieces of width at least `δ` around every cone,
arranged by the scale hierarchy of §7.

`CRNT.Geometry.PolyhedralBarrier` formalizes the invariance engine for such a surface:
for `g X = max i (⟪n i, X⟫ - b i)` the sublevel set `{g ≤ R}` is forward invariant for any
field lying in the polar cones of the active normals.  What is *not* formalized, and is the
remaining gap, is the existence of the data feeding that engine for an arbitrary complete
pointed fan: a family `n C ∈ C` indexed by the cones with `⟪n C, x⟫ ≥ ⟪n C', x⟫` for all
`x ∈ C`, together with the separation scales.  That family is a finite convex-geometry object —
equivalently the face points of a polytope whose normal fan refines the fan — and Mathlib
currently has no polytope, face-lattice, or normal-fan API to build it on.

## Trust status

`#print axioms CRNT.Network.exists_positive_omegaPoint_of_highCodimension_siphonFace` reports
`sorryAx`, and so do exactly its downstream consumers
`Network.complexBalanced_genuinePermanent`, `Network.complexBalanced_permanent`, and
`Network.complexBalanced_globalAttractor`.  No other declaration in the tree does.

All hypotheses are exactly the data available at the corresponding point of
`Network.complexBalanced_genuinePermanent`:

* `hxs`, `hcb`: a positive complex-balanced equilibrium for the rates `κ`;

  exactly the nonempty species set `Pmax`, and `Pmax` is maximal among zero sets of ω-points —
  no ω-point has a zero set of larger cardinality (`hzcard`), and every ω-point vanishing on
  `Pmax` vanishes exactly on `Pmax` (`hmaxExact`);

  and `Pmax` has at least two species — both supplied by

The conclusion is the interior certificate `PositiveOmegaPointForRates` consumes. -/

/-! ## Why the packaged barrier criteria cannot be instantiated inside this theorem

`docs/gac-bridge-gap-analysis.lean` derives the conclusion of the theorem above from the blueprint
data consumed by `Network.exists_positive_omegaPoint_of_blueprintData`, so the residue there is
purely geometric: the tiles, their normals and their levels.  The two lemmas below record the
obstruction found while trying to close that instantiation from this theorem's hypotheses: the
blueprint data *cannot* exist under them.

Every packaged criterion — `exists_positive_omegaPoint_of_convex_tiles`,
`exists_positive_omegaPoint_of_selfConsistent_normals`,
`exists_positive_omegaPoint_of_blueprintData` — demands a separation clause `hsep` bounding each
coordinate below by some `ε > 0` on **every** positive compatible point of the closed sublevel
`{barrier ≤ R}`.  Two facts collide there:

* `hstart` puts the start point `x₀` into the sublevel, and the trapping theorem
  `Network.barrier_le_of_toric_descent_in_band` (fed by the `hnear` clause assembled from `hm`,
  `hassign` and `hregime`) bounds the barrier by `R` along the whole orbit, so
  `barrier_le_of_mem_omegaLimit` puts the boundary ω-point `wmax` into the sublevel as well;
* every piece `innerSL ℝ (-m i)` of the barrier is affine, hence the sublevel is convex, so the
  segment from `x₀` to `wmax` stays inside it — and `hsep_fails_of_boundaryPoint_mem_sublevel`
  refutes `hsep` on that segment: its points are positive and compatible, but at any `s ∈ Pmax`
  the segment takes the value `(x₀ s) / n`, which tends to zero.

So instantiating any of these criteria from this theorem's hypotheses would derive `False` — it
would prove that `omegaLimit` meets **no** boundary face at all (full permanence), a strictly
stronger statement than the conclusion demanded here, which only asks for a positive ω-point *in
addition to* the boundary ones.  (`hMclass`, which
`exists_positive_omegaPoint_of_blueprintData` needs separately, is itself unavailable for
non-conservative networks, whose positive compatibility classes are unbounded.)

What is still missing is a criterion that exhibits an interior ω-point without uniform coordinate
floors: an Anderson-style comparable-growth descent (`Network.ComparableGrowthDescent`, whose
finite induction `omegaLimit_positive_of_descend` is already proved) or a direct
polyhedral-surface argument.  The two lemmas below are the machine-checked core of this analysis;
the wiring to each criterion's hypotheses is the paragraph above.

Depends additionally on: `CRNT.Dynamics.ToricBarrierTrapping`.

/-- **The separation clause `hsep` of the packaged barrier criteria is refutable as soon as a
boundary point of the ω-limit set sits in the closed sublevel together with the start point.**

Each piece of `PolyhedralBarrier.barrier` is affine, so the sublevel `{barrier ≤ R}` is convex;
the segment from `x₀` to `wmax` therefore stays inside it.  Its points
`z = x₀ / n + (1 - 1/n) · wmax` are positive (`x₀` positive, `wmax` nonnegative) and compatible
with `x₀` (the displacement is a scalar multiple of `wmax - x₀`), but at a zero coordinate
`wmax s = 0` of `wmax` the segment value is `x₀ s / n → 0`, which no `ε > 0` can bound below. -/

/-! ## The packaging audit against Craciun v3 (arXiv:1501.02860v3)

The question raised while reading the paper — do Theorem B / Lemma 9.5 / Lemma 9.7 *assume*
uniform coordinate floors, or *prove* them? — has a definite answer, and it fixes two places where
the repo's packaging is stronger than the paper's text, plus one place where it is exactly right.

**1. `hsep` is a conclusion of the paper, never a hypothesis.**  Definition 4.6 defines a ZSH by
(i) `𝒵 ⊂ ℝⁿ₊ \ (η + ℝⁿ₊)` — the *surface* stays out of the deep interior box, i.e. it hugs the
boundary, the opposite direction from a floor — (ii) `𝒵` meets every toric ray exactly once, and
(iii) `𝒵` cannot be crossed inside some cube `(0,M)ⁿ`.  Lemma 9.5 assumes only "`𝒵` is a ZSH" and
concludes that the outer normal at `x` lies in every cone `𝒞` with `log x ∈ 𝒞`.  Lemma 9.7 assumes
only (i) for the unit cube (`𝒵 ⊂ (0,1)³ \ (ε̂ + [0,1]³)`) together with the normal-in-`K_𝒞`
condition, and concludes non-crossing inside the unit cube.  No coordinate floor appears in either
statement.  The floor on the *region* — "the upper region of `ℋ` is at positive distance from
`∂ℝⁿ`", part of the statement of Theorem B — is produced by the construction: §8 Step 2 chooses
`ε₀ < x₀ⁱ`, so `(ε₀,…,ε₀) + ℝⁿ₊` lies above `𝒵_{ε₀}`, and the compact invariant set is
`K_{x₀} = (above 𝒵_{ε₀}) ∩ [0,M]ⁿ ∩ {V ≤ L}` with `V` the Horn–Jackson Lyapunov function (§6.1 and
Fig. 3(e); Lemma 9.11 puts `{V ≤ L}` between two simplices, which is where the outer bound comes
from).

**2. The two lemmas above therefore say something stronger than "the criteria are mis-packaged":
every uniform-floor statement is refutable under this theorem's hypotheses, because `wmax` sits in
`ω`.**  For the repo's *convex* barrier sublevels this is
`hsep_fails_of_boundaryPoint_mem_sublevel` — the segment `x₀ / n + (1 - 1/n) · wmax` stays inside
and takes the value `x₀ s / n → 0` — together with `barrier_le_of_mem_omegaLimit`, which puts
`wmax` into any sublevel that traps the orbit.  For the paper's own region no convexity is needed
and none should be assumed (the paper never claims `K_{x₀}` is convex; see 4): compactness plus
`K_{x₀} ⊂ ℝⁿ_{>0}` already forces `wmax ∈ K_{x₀}` to be positive, contradicting
`hPmaxne`/`hzeroMax`.  So no weaker geometric statement and no repackaging of a *uniform-floor*
criterion can be instantiated here — each of them proves full permanence, which `wmax` refutes —
and once the §4 existence claim (item 5) is available this theorem closes by `False`.

**3. `hMclass` is the repo's hypothesis, not the paper's.**  Craciun never assumes bounded
compatibility classes.  His standing hypotheses are weak reversibility (Theorem 4.3 embeds a
variable-`k` weakly reversible system into a toric differential inclusion), and the boundedness he
uses is that of the *trajectory*: §8's remark proves that "any bounded trajectory of a variable-`k`
weakly reversible system is persistent", and the outer bound `M` comes from the cube `[0,M]ⁿ`
containing the chosen level surface `ℒ` (§6.1) together with `V ≤ L` — it bounds the invariant
region, not the class.  The class-wide bound fails in the paper's own setting:
`CRNT.Examples.OpenSystem.exists_complexBalanced_unbounded_class` constructs a weakly reversible
network of deficiency zero — hence complex balanced for *every* rate vector, so it carries exactly
this theorem's `hxs`/`hcb` — whose stoichiometric subspace is everything, so no `M` bounds its
positive compatibility classes.  `hMclass` is therefore not derivable here; it is available only on
conservative networks (the all-ones law bounds the class), which is what the `ToricBarrierExplicit`
docstrings scope it to.

**4. The convex obstruction checks out.**  `ConvexBarrierObstruction.not_exists_weights_vector`
proves that no globally homogeneous max-of-affine barrier can carry a normal lying inside every
cone of a generic three-dimensional arrangement fan.  The paper never asks for one: its
non-crossing requirement is confined to a bounded window — the unit cube of Lemma 9.7, the blue box
`[0,M_{n+1}]×…×[0,M₂]` of §8 Step 1 in compactified log coordinates — and inside a bounded window
the constant offsets `b_i` *can* repair the violations, which is precisely the step ("the deficit
scales linearly in `X` along `𝒞`") that fails on an unbounded cone.  The §7.4.3 `ε(α)` scale
hierarchy then handles the remaining self-consistency fixed point.  The repo's reading of the
obstruction, recorded in that module's header, matches the paper.

**5. The missing object already has a name in this tree.**  v3 §4 states the whole content in one
sentence: "for any positive initial condition `x₀ ∈ ℝⁿ_{>0}` of a toric dynamical system there
exists a compact forward invariant region `K_{x₀} ⊂ ℝⁿ_{>0}` such that `x₀ ∈ K_{x₀}`.  Of course,
this implies that toric dynamical systems are persistent."  Up to the packaging of forward
invariance, that is `N.PersistentFrom κ x₀` (`SingleLinkageGAC.lean:46`: a compact `K₀`, every
point of `K₀` strictly positive, every genuine solution through `x₀` staying in `K₀`), whose
orbit-level shadow is `Permanent ϕ x₀` (`EndotacticPermanence.lean:58`).  Both already yield this
theorem's conclusion: `omegaLimit_meets_positive_of_permanent` *is* the conclusion above, and
`persistentOrbit_of_persistentFrom` plus `PersistentOrbit.omegaLimit_positive` gives it for
`PersistentFrom`.  Two remarks, both checked against the text: (a) `K_{x₀}` compact and inside the
*open* orthant already forces `dist(K_{x₀}, ∂) > 0`, so no separate separation statement is
needed — in particular the segment argument of `hsep_fails_of_boundaryPoint_mem_sublevel` plays no
role here (it belongs to the repo's convex max-of-affine packaging, which the paper's tile-by-tile
surface is not — see 4); (b) feeding `PersistentFrom` to the chain above under this theorem's
hypotheses produces a *positive* `wmax` (`wmax ∈ ω ⊆ K₀`, `K₀` closed), contradicting
`hPmaxne`/`hzeroMax` — i.e. the residual is inconsistent with `PersistentFrom`, which is the
machine-checkable form of "closing this `sorry` = supplying that compact positive absorbing set
for the bounded orbit at hand".  *Correction, verified against the v3 source by `GacLit` (shared
log, `[GacLit] 19:47`): the paper does **not** prove that such a `K_{x₀}` exists.*  The claim
appears only as statements — §4 (plan lines 598/637, whose "Step 4" is the assembly), 2D figure
captions, §5 LaSalle prose — while §8 carries out Steps 1–2 and then stops; there is no
"§8 Step 4".  Lemmas 9.5/9.7 are stated only for `ℝ³`/`(0,1)³` although §8 Step 2 invokes Lemma 9.7
in `n` dimensions, and Lemma 9.11's proof is a one-paragraph sketch.  The honest accounting of the
gap is therefore: **Theorem B (§§5–8) + the Step-4 assembly the paper asserts but does not write
down + LaSalle/persistence.**  v3 is a preprint (v1 2015, v2 2016, v3 2026-09-23, no journal-ref)
treated as open in current literature — Wiuf, arXiv:2609.24553v1, lists the GAC as proved only in
special cases and does not cite 1501.02860; no erratum or refutation was found — so speak of the
*claimed* proof.

/-- **The paper's §4 region cannot exist under this theorem's hypotheses.**
`N.PersistentFrom κ x₀` (`SingleLinkageGAC.lean:46`) is verbatim Craciun v3 §4 — "a compact
forward invariant region `K_{x₀} ⊂ ℝⁿ_{>0}` such that `x₀ ∈ K_{x₀}`" — and it already implies
this file's conclusion (`omegaLimit_meets_positive_of_permanent`, or
`persistentOrbit_of_persistentFrom` together with `PersistentOrbit.omegaLimit_positive`).  The
lemma below records the other side of the collision: if the ω-limit set contains a point that is
not strictly positive — this theorem has `wmax`, with `wmax s = 0` for the nonempty set `Pmax` —
then `PersistentFrom κ x₀` is refutable, because the certificate's compact set would have to
contain that point while being entirely inside the open orthant.

Consequently the `sorry` above is discharged by *any* construction of `PersistentFrom κ x₀` for
this orbit — which is what v3 *claims* to obtain from boundedness alone (the residual has
boundedness: `hK`/`hmaps`; the claim is the "Step 4" of §4's plan, asserted but not carried out —
see the audit above) — and, read the other way, the residual hypotheses are inconsistent with that
claim, i.e. with the *claimed* Theorem B/C. -/

/-! ## The static slice of Anderson's descent that IS available here

Route (A)/(B) of the residual: apply `omegaLimit_positive_of_descend` from
`CRNT.Dynamics.SiphonDimensionDescent`, whose strong induction on the siphon cardinality is already
proved.  Its sole input is `N.ComparableGrowthDescent ϕ x₀`, and all the structural data it needs
*along the way* is derivable from this theorem's own hypotheses — no call-site fields are missing:
`criticalBoundaryOmegaFace_lowerRank` (from `weaklyReversible_of_positive_complexBalanced` and
`exists_relEntropy_const_on_omegaLimit`) supplies `IsCriticalSiphon Pmax`, the complex-balance of
the avoiding-face restriction at `fillSiphonFace Pmax xstar wmax`, the strict stoichiometric rank
drop, and `massActionVectorField κ wmax = 0`, and `⟨wmax, hwmax, hzeroMax⟩` is the carriedness
witness.

Two facts then resist, and the lemma below discharges the part of them that is static:

* `hmaxExact` can only ever *exclude* candidates for the descent's right disjunct, never produce
  one: a carried `Q` with `Q.card < Pmax.card` cannot contain `Pmax`, so its witness `z` does not
  satisfy the premise `∀ s ∈ Pmax, z s = 0` that `hmaxExact z` needs.  Eliminating all candidates
  would make `descend Pmax` equivalent to the very goal of this theorem — circular.
* what the right disjunct needs is a carried critical siphon of **strictly smaller** cardinality.
  `exists_smaller_carried_siphon_of_zeroSet_inside` constructs one whenever some ω-point is
  positive on `Pmaxᶜ`, vanishes at some species of `Pmax`, and is positive at some species of
  `Pmax` — in the absence of a positive ω-point.  The uncovered branch — every ω-point that is
  positive on `Pmax` also vanishes *outside* `Pmax`, where no static cardinality bound is
  available — is exactly
  Anderson's comparable-growth estimate: comparing relative-entropy growth across an escape from
  the face, which is the analytic content `ComparableGrowthDescent` isolates and the tree does not
  formalise.  (The degenerate ω-limit set `ω = {wmax}` shows why no purely static argument can
  finish: there the right disjunct at `Pmax` is false outright, so any static proof of
  `descend Pmax` would prove this theorem's goal — i.e. would already be the missing result.) -/

/-- **A strictly smaller carried critical siphon, from an ω-point whose zero set sits strictly
inside `Pmax`.**

Under this theorem's orbit hypotheses, if the ω-limit set contains no positive point, and some
`z ∈ ω` is positive on every species outside `Pmax`, vanishes at some species of `Pmax`, and is
positive at some species of `Pmax`, then the zero set `Q` of `z` is nonempty (positivity fails
somewhere, and off `Pmax` nothing vanishes, so the failure is on `Pmax`), strictly smaller than
`Pmax` (it omits the species where `z` is positive), carried by `z`, and critical — so it is
exactly a right-disjunct witness for `descend Pmax` of `Network.ComparableGrowthDescent`. -/

/-! ## The exact residue: the vanishing-off-`Pmax` pin, the conservation mechanism, and the
exhaustive trichotomy

`hzcard` (newly exported from `exists_maximal_zeroSet_omegaPoint` and threaded through the call
site) bounds every ω-point's zero set by `Pmax.card`.  With it, four lemmas pin down *exactly*
what remains of Anderson's descent at `Pmax`:

* `exists_positive_on_pmax_of_zero_outside`: an ω-point that vanishes **outside** `Pmax` must be
  positive somewhere **on** `Pmax` — otherwise `hmaxExact` would force its zero set to equal
  `Pmax`, contradicting the outside zero.  So the “vanishes off `Pmax`” configuration cannot hide
  from `hmaxExact`; it simply cannot be *killed* by it.
* `eq_zero_on_pmax_of_conservation_eq`: the compatibility-class mechanism.  If the invariant `c`
  does not see the off-`Pmax` part of `z - wmax` (`hout`), then a `P`-invariant that is
  nonnegative and strictly positive on `Pmax` forces `z = 0` on `Pmax`, and `hmaxExact` then
  collapses `z` to `Pmax` exactly — contradicting any outside zero.  What resists: `hout` is
  *agreement off `Pmax`* (or `c` supported inside `Pmax`), and neither is available for an
  arbitrary ω-point — ω-points of one class vary freely off the face — while an invariant that
  is nonnegative everywhere and positive on **all** of `Pmax` would be a witness to
  `¬ N.IsCriticalSiphon Pmax`, which the derived `IsCriticalSiphon Pmax` forbids.  The mechanism
  is exact but not instantiable here.
* `smaller_carried_siphon_iff_zeroSet_card_lt`: absent a positive ω-point, the descent's right
  disjunct is *equivalent* to “some ω-point has a strictly smaller zero set”.
* `omegaPoint_zeroSet_trichotomy`: every ω-point either is strictly positive (the goal of this
  theorem), or its zero set is exactly `Pmax`, or it witnesses a strictly smaller carried siphon
  (the right disjunct), or it is an exact tie — positive somewhere on `Pmax`, vanishing
  somewhere off it, with `card = Pmax.card`.  Exhaustive.  **Two** disjuncts stay open, not one:
  “every ω-point has zero set exactly `Pmax`” (the degenerate model `ω = {wmax}` lives there) and
  the exact ties (where the conservation mechanism above is blocked as recorded).  Both are
  dynamical: no static lemma can close either, since the model satisfies every static hypothesis
  and every derived fact. -/

/-- **An ω-point vanishing outside `Pmax` is positive somewhere on `Pmax`.**  Feeding `hmaxExact`
its premise would force the zero set to equal `Pmax` exactly, which the outside zero contradicts;
so the premise must fail. -/

part of the difference (`hout` — subsuming both “`z` and `wmax` agree off `Pmax`” and “`c` is
supported inside `Pmax`”), the whole invariant total sits on `Pmax`, and a nonnegative `c`
positive there forces `z = 0` on `Pmax`.  Then `hmaxExact` collapses `z` to `Pmax` exactly. -/

/-! ## One consequence of the standing hypotheses that the trichotomy alone does not record

`massActionVectorField_eq_zero_on_omegaLimit_of_hypotheses`: **every ω-point is an equilibrium**
of the mass-action field.  LaSalle for the relative entropy (available from
`hxs`/`hcb`/`hϕγ`/`hsol`/`hK`/`hmaps`) feeds
`GACOmegaPositive.massActionVectorField_eq_zero_on_omegaLimit`, which covers boundary ω-points as
well (their zero sets are siphons, so the face argument applies).

Note that the *third* disjunct of `omegaPoint_zeroSet_trichotomy` (a strictly smaller carried
critical siphon) is **not** refutable from `hzcard`: `hzcard` only says no ω-point's zero set is
*larger* than `Pmax.card`, which is perfectly consistent with one being strictly smaller. -/

/-- **Every ω-point is a stationary point of the mass-action vector field.**  Under exactly the
orbit hypotheses of this module, together with a positive complex-balanced reference and the
genuine solution property of the start orbit, relative entropy is constant on the ω-limit set and
the boundary-face analysis of `CRNT.Dynamics.GACOmegaPositive` turns that constancy into
`N.massActionVectorField κ z = 0` for *every* `z ∈ omegaLimit atTop ϕ {x₀}` — boundary points
included. -/

/-! ## The open residue is pinned: off-`Pmax` coordinates never approach zero

Both disjuncts left open by `omegaPoint_zeroSet_trichotomy` share one feature — some ω-point
vanishes on all of `Pmax` (`hface` below), which every tie witness also satisfies after
specialising `hmaxExact`.  The lemma then says that the failure of positivity is *confined* to
`Pmax`: every coordinate outside `Pmax` keeps a uniform positive floor for all forward time, so
the trajectory converges to the **relative interior** of the `Pmax` face and all of its limit
points are positive exactly on `Pmaxᶜ`.

This does not close the theorem — it sharpens what has to be closed.  Excluding this
configuration is the dynamical content of Craciun's Theorem B (v3 §7–§8): the degenerate model
`ω = {wmax}` satisfies every static hypothesis of this module and satisfies the conclusion of the
lemma below, so no static refinement can finish. -/

omit [DecidableEq S] [Fintype S] in
/-- **Off-`Pmax` coordinates are uniformly bounded below along the entire orbit.**  If every
ω-point vanishes on `Pmax`, `hmaxExact` holds, and `t₀ ∉ Pmax`, then there is `ε > 0` with
`ε ≤ γ x₀ t t₀` for every `t ≥ 0`.

Minimize the continuous coordinate `t₀` over the compact ω-limit set; the minimum `m` is strictly
positive, since `m = 0` would put a ω-point with `z t₀ = 0` in front of `hmaxExact`, contradicting
`t₀ ∉ Pmax`.  The open half-space `{y | m/2 < y t₀}` therefore contains ω, so
`eventually_closure_subset_of_isCompact_absorbing_of_isOpen_of_omegaLimit_subset` pushes the whole
forward orbit into it after some time `T`; on the compact initial segment `[0,T]` continuity and
orbit positivity supply a second floor, and the minimum of the two floors is the witness. -/

/-! ## The chemical reading: what the relative entropy does at the boundary

The Horn–Jackson Lyapunov function in this repository is the finite sum
`relEntropy xstar x = ∑ i, (x i * log (x i / xstar i) - x i + xstar i)`
(`CRNT/Theorems/DeficiencyZero/Lyapunov.lean:58`), evaluated with Mathlib's convention
`Real.log 0 = 0`.  At a coordinate whose species has gone extinct the summand is
`0 * log 0 - 0 + xstar i = xstar i`: the entropy is **finite on the whole closed orthant** and
continuous there (`relEntropy_continuous`).  So the heuristic "relative entropy blows up at zero
concentration, contradicting its constancy on the ω-limit set" is unavailable here — it dies
precisely at the definition, where the boundary value is defined to be the finite number
`xstar s` per extinct coordinate rather than `+∞`.

What survives the failed blow-up is exact bookkeeping, and it is what the two lemmas below
record.  Every extinct species *raises* the entropy by exactly its reference value (the
`- x i + xstar i` part contributes `xstar s` at `x i = 0`), every surviving coordinate
contributes a nonnegative amount (Gibbs' inequality, `relEntropyTerm_nonneg`), hence:

* `relEntropy_ge_sum_zeroSet` — the total reference weight of any extinct set is capped by the
  entropy value at the point;
* `relEntropy_le_of_mem_omegaLimit` — Lyapunov descent plus continuity put the entire ω-limit
  set inside the sublevel `{relEntropy xstar · ≤ relEntropy xstar x₀}`;
* `sum_xstar_le_relEntropy_x₀_of_zero_omegaPoint` — transporting the cap through the ω-limit
  set: for the residual's `wmax` with zero set `Pmax`, the extinct set's reference weight is
  bounded by the *initial* entropy,

      ∑ s ∈ Pmax, xstar s ≤ relEntropy xstar x₀.

Combined with `exists_relEntropy_const_on_omegaLimit` (the LaSalle constant `c` is the value of
the entropy on every ω-point) this pins `c ≥ ∑ s ∈ Pmax, xstar s > 0`: a strictly positive floor
on the LaSalle constant of any trajectory whose ω-limit meets the boundary.  It is a genuine
constraint — but not a contradiction: `relEntropy xstar x₀` is an arbitrary nonnegative number
and can exceed any finite reference weight, so the cap alone cannot exclude `Pmax` and cannot
deliver the positive ω-point.  The missing dynamical content remains Craciun v3 Theorem B, as
documented at the head of this file.
-/

/-- **The reference weight of an extinct set is capped by the relative entropy.** For a
nonnegative concentration `x` and any set `Z` of coordinates vanishing at `x`, the sum of the
reference values `xstar s` over `s ∈ Z` is at most `relEntropy xstar x`.  Each summand of the
entropy over `Z` equals `xstar s` (by `Real.log 0 = 0`) and each summand outside `Z` is
nonnegative by `relEntropyTerm_nonneg`.  This is the finite substitute for entropy blow-up at
the boundary: the entropy does not diverge as a species goes extinct, it rises by exactly the
extinct species' reference value. -/

`CRNT.Examples.CodimTwoFaceModel` shows by an explicit model that every hypothesis of
`exists_positive_omegaPoint_of_highCodimension_siphonFace` except the orbit-ODE premise `hsol`
is satisfiable simultaneously with the conclusion false, so `hsol` is the only load-bearing
premise no static argument can avoid.  Within the remaining hypotheses, three are derivable
from the others and carry no independent content; they are recorded here so that no future
argument spends effort on them:

* `hmaxExact_of_zeroSet_card_le`: `hmaxExact` follows from `hzcard` alone (the maximality
  argument of `exists_maximal_zeroSet_omegaPoint` needs no more than the cardinality bound);
* `two_le_card_of_two_le_finrank_map_projOn`: `hcard` follows from `hcodim`, since the
  `Pmax`-projection lives in the space of functions supported on `Pmax`, of dimension
  `Pmax.card` (so `hPmaxne` follows from `hcard` in turn);
* `stoichRank_ne_one_of_two_le_finrank_map_projOn`: `hrank` follows from `hcodim`, since the
  rank of a projected subspace never exceeds the rank of `stoichSubspace` itself
  (`stoichRank = finrank stoichSubspace ≥ 2`). -/

/-! ## The exact applicability boundary of `uniformLowerBound_offFace_of_zeroSet_eq`

Its hypothesis `hface : ∀ z ∈ omegaLimit …, ∀ s ∈ Pmax, z s = 0` is *universal*: every
ω-point must vanish on the whole face.  The trichotomy
`omegaPoint_zeroSet_trichotomy` only yields, in its third disjunct, a **per-point** split
`∀ z, Z(z) = Pmax ∨ tie(z)`, where a tie witness is positive somewhere on `Pmax` and therefore
violates `hface`.  The lemma below pins the boundary exactly: given `hmaxExact`, `hface` is
equivalent to "every ω-point has zero set exactly `Pmax`" — so it is obtainable when the
branch-(2) shape holds for *all* ω-points (in particular in the degenerate model
`ω = {wmax}`), and it *fails* whenever a tie witness (or any mixed ω-set) exists.  The module
docstring above `uniformLowerBound_offFace_of_zeroSet_eq` says both open disjuncts "share" `hface`;
that is correct only for the existential reading ("some ω-point vanishes on `Pmax`", namely
`wmax` itself) — for the universal `hface` of the lemma the tie branch is not covered. -/

/-! ## The ω-limit set cannot be split by two closed sets: ties do not mix with face points

`omegaPoint_zeroSet_trichotomy`'s third disjunct is a *per-point* disjunction, so it permits a
mixed ω-limit set — some points exactly on the `Pmax`-face, some exact ties.  The two lemmas
below rule the mixture out.  `omegaLimit_eq_iInter_closure_tail` writes ω as the intersection of
the closures of the forward tails of the orbit; each such tail closure is compact (the orbit
lives in `K`) and contains ω.  `not_disjoint_closed_cover_omegaLimit` is then Cantor's
intersection theorem in disguise: two disjoint nonempty closed subsets of ω would give disjoint
open neighborhoods `U`, `V`, some tail closure would fall inside `U ∪ V`, and a continuous
segment of the orbit meeting both `U` and `V` would have to cross `U ∩ V = ∅`. -/

/-! ## Branch (4) of the residue is dead: ties cannot coexist with face points

`omegaPoint_zeroSet_trichotomy`'s third disjunct is a *per-point* disjunction, so it permits a
mixed ω-limit set — some points exactly on the `Pmax`-face, some exact ties.  The lemma below
rules the mixture out and therefore pins the residue: whenever the third disjunct holds, **every**
ω-point vanishes on `Pmax`, i.e. the `hface` hypothesis of
`uniformLowerBound_offFace_of_zeroSet_eq` is available. -/

/-- **Ties cannot mix with face points: the trichotomy's third disjunct forces `hface`.**

Under the standing orbit hypotheses, if every ω-point either vanishes on all of `Pmax` or
vanishes somewhere outside `Pmax` (the shape of the trichotomy's third disjunct), then in fact
*every* ω-point vanishes on `Pmax`.

Proof: the face points `A` and the tie witnesses `T` are closed subsets of ω (ω itself is closed),
disjoint by `hmaxExact`, cover ω by the hypothesis, and `A` is nonempty because `wmax` lies in it.
`not_disjoint_closed_cover_omegaLimit` (Cantor's intersection theorem applied to the closures of
the forward tails of the orbit) says such a partition cannot exist unless `T` is empty. -/

/-! ## Branch (2): the Step-4 `K_{x₀}` assembly — exact statement, provenance, and the bridge v3
never writes

This is the compact forward-invariant `K_{x₀} ⊂ ℝⁿ_{>0}` route (v3 §4 line 598, the claim the
paper asserts but never proves).  The transcription below was checked against both arXiv sources
by `GacLit` (verbatim quotes recorded in the collaboration log, 2026-09-28).  Three layers:

**Layer A — what this file's proof actually consumes** (pure repo, no paper):

```
∃ K : Set (Concentration S), IsCompact K ∧ (∀ y ∈ K, Concentration.Positive y) ∧
  x₀ ∈ K ∧ ∀ t : ℝ≥0, ϕ t x₀ ∈ K
```

Its orbit-level form is `Permanent ϕ x₀`; both certificate forms are already in-tree —
`PersistentFrom κ x₀` (`SingleLinkageGAC.lean`, *verbatim* line 598: "compact forward invariant
region `K_{x₀} ⊂ ℝⁿ_{>0}` such that `x₀ ∈ K_{x₀}`") and `SeparatingConfinement κ x₀`
(`GACSeparatingCapstone.lean`, the floor form) — and both directions are pinned: the certificate
implies this theorem's conclusion (`omegaLimit_meets_positive_of_permanent`), and a non-positive
ω-point refutes it (`not_persistentFrom_of_mem_omegaLimit_notPositive` above).

**Layer B — the paper-asserted claim.**  v3 §4 line 598, verbatim: "for any positive initial
condition `x₀ ∈ ℝⁿ_{>0}` of a toric dynamical system there exists a compact forward invariant
region `K_{x₀} ⊂ ℝⁿ_{>0}` such that `x₀ ∈ K_{x₀}`".  Asserted outright; region-level invariance
(all solutions starting in `K`) at lines 598/637, cube-conditional only at intro line 309; no
proof anywhere in v3 — §8 stops after Steps 1–2 and there is no "§8 Step 4".

**Layer C — the construction shape.**  v3 tex line 586 (commented-out draft, verbatim):
`ℝⁿ₊ⁿ \ 𝒵` is the union of two disjoint connected open sets `Zlow`, `Zupper` with `Zlow ⊂ V₀` (`V₀` a
neighborhood of the origin, defined inline in the same sentence and nowhere else), `Zupper` invariant,
and the closure of `Zupper` does not contain the origin — the *origin-avoidance* era: it does **not**
give `K ⊂ ℝⁿ₊ⁿ` (a point like `(1,0)` misses the origin yet has a zero coordinate).  The full
boundary floor exists only (i) in v2 §6 verbatim — the final region "does not contain any points
at distance less than `ε_{n-1} > 0` from the boundary of `ℝ₊ⁿ`" — and (ii) as bare assertions in
v3: line 598 (`K ⊂ ℝⁿ₊ⁿ`) and intro line 309 ("at positive distance from `∂ℝⁿ₊ⁿ`").  The familiar
formula `K = (upper region) ∩ [0,M]ⁿ ∩ {V ≤ L}` is an **[INFERENCE]-reconstruction**: lines
600/637/946 (Horn–Jackson level sets determine `K`) + 309 (the cube) assert its factors
separately; no source writes the formula.  The published three-species `K` of CNP §7 is an
analogous but different box-and-cuts shape.

**The remaining burden** is therefore exactly one interface, which the two lemmas below consume
and assemble: a surface split of the open orthant whose upper side `Zupper` (i) contains `x₀`,
(ii) has a uniform coordinate floor `ε`, and (iii) is never left by the orbit (the orbit never
meets `𝒵 = {x | x.Positive} \ (Zlow ∪ Zupper)` — non-crossing of Def. 4.6(iii)).  Note what is *not*
consumed: the connectedness of `Zlow`/`Zupper` from line 586, and `V₀` — the connectivity that the
assembly needs is that of the orbit's time-image, supplied by `orbit_stays_in_upperRegion`.
That lemma is v3 §9.1's announced-but-never-stated "non-crossing ⟹ forward invariance" bridge in
the two-region form; the repo already holds the barrier form of the same bridge
(`forwardInvariant_barrier_toricInclusion`, `barrier_le_of_toric_descent_in_band`).  The second
lemma assembles Layer A with
`K := closure Zupper ∩ {y | y.Nonnegative ∧ relEntropy xstar y ≤ relEntropy xstar x₀}`: closed floors
survive into `closure Zupper`, boundedness and closedness come from `isCompact_relEntropy_sublevel`
(the Horn–Jackson level through `x₀`, the [INFERENCE] Layer-C factor), invariance from the bridge
plus Lyapunov descent, and positivity from the floor.  No `hMclass`, no convex barrier, no `hsep`,
so the packaged criteria's refutable clauses (`hsep_fails_of_boundaryPoint_mem_sublevel`) do not
touch this shape — a non-convex upper region is exactly what escapes the segment argument.

/-- **The missing §9.1 bridge: non-crossing ⟹ the orbit stays in the upper region.**

A continuous orbit defined on the nonnegative times whose values always lie in the union of two
disjoint open sets, and which starts in `Zupper`, stays in `Zupper` for all forward time.  The orbit's
time-image is connected (`IsConnected.image` of `Ici 0`), a connected subset of a disjoint open
cover lies entirely in one side (`IsPreconnected.subset_or_subset`), and the start point picks
the side.  In the paper's language: a solution that never meets the zero-separating surface `𝒵`
cannot pass from the upper region `Zupper` to `Zlow` — v3 §9.1 announces this transfer for forward
invariant regions and never states it; v3 tex line 586's `Zupper`-invariance is the same claim as
commented-out text. -/

/-- **The Step-4 assembly, as a criterion: a floored, never-crossed upper region closes the goal.**

This is the Lean statement of what `K_{x₀}` must satisfy, with the surface burden isolated in the
hypotheses (the three-layer transcription and its provenance are in the module doc above):

* `hopenLow hopenUp hdisj hsplit` — the two-region split: `Zlow ∪ Zupper` is the complement of the
  surface `𝒵` inside the open orthant (tex 586), and the orbit never meets `𝒵`;
* `hx₀Z` — `x₀` sits on the upper side (Thm B footnote: "`x₀` is in the upper region");
* `hfloor` — the upper region is at distance `ε > 0` from `∂ℝⁿ₊ⁿ` (line 309; v2 §6's final floor);
* `hε hxs hcb hx₀ hϕγ hsol` — the complex-balanced genuine orbit.

The assembled `K` is `closure Zupper ∩ {y | y.Nonnegative ∧ relEntropy xstar y ≤ relEntropy xstar x₀}`:
compact (Horn–Jackson level through `x₀`), inside the open orthant (floor survives closure),
containing `x₀`, and absorbing the orbit (bridge + Lyapunov descent) — Layer A above, hence the
conclusion.  What remains unconstructed in the tree is exactly the surface data: the blueprint of
v3 §§5–8 whose non-crossing and floor properties the hypotheses record. -/
