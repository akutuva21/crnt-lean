# Adjudication: `exists_positive_omegaPoint_of_upperRegion` cannot be applied under the
# hypotheses of the Global Attractor hole

`CRNT/Dynamics/HighCodimensionSiphonFace.lean:135` carries the tree's single remaining
obligation for `Network.complexBalanced_genuinePermanent`.  Two candidate endgames were
under consideration for it, and they were believed to be mutually exclusive:

* `exists_positive_omegaPoint_of_upperRegion` (same file, :1596), whose only unbuilt inputs
  are `hfloor` and the non-crossing condition `hsplit`;
* the packaged barrier/blueprint criteria reachable through `CRNT.Geometry.CraciunZSH`.

They **are** mutually exclusive, and this module settles which side of the fork the hole
falls on, by machine check rather than by argument.

## The verdict

`false_of_upperRegion_and_boundaryOmegaPoint` below: take *every* hypothesis of
`exists_positive_omegaPoint_of_upperRegion` — including `hfloor` — together with the
ω-limit-set hypotheses the hole supplies (`hwmax`, `hPmaxne`, `hzeroMax`), and conclude
`False`.

So `hfloor` is not an "unbuilt input" that a later researcher is expected to discharge. It
is a hypothesis that is **unsatisfiable** under the hole's own hypotheses, and establishing
it proves the full Global Attractor Conjecture in a degenerate way (every ω-point would be
strictly positive, so no ω-point could vanish anywhere at all).

## Why, and where the disagreement came from

The intuition that `hfloor` is "a floor on a *region*, not along the orbit" and is therefore
untouched by the orbit-level obstructions is correct as far as it goes, and it is exactly the
intuition that makes `exists_positive_omegaPoint_of_upperRegion` look like the live route.
The obstruction is one step further along, and it is a step the criterion's own proof takes:

1. `orbit_stays_in_upperRegion` (`HighCodimensionSiphonFace.lean:1508`) turns non-crossing
   (`hsplit`) plus the start point `hx₀Z` into `γ x₀ t ∈ Zupper` for **all** forward `t`.  So
   the whole forward orbit lies in `Zupper`, hence in `closure Zupper`.
2. Every ω-limit point lies in the closure of the forward orbit's image
   (`omegaLimit_subset_closure_image2`).  Hence `ω ⊆ closure Zupper`.
3. `hfloor` is stated on `Zupper`, but the criterion consumes it through
   `closure_minimal … hFloorClosed`, i.e. as `closure Zupper ⊆ {y | ∀ s, ε ≤ y s}` — a
   statement about the **closure**, not about `Zupper`.  The floor therefore does reach `ω`.
4. So every ω-point is strictly positive.  Under `hzeroMax` and `hPmaxne` the hole's `wmax`
   has a zero coordinate and is in `ω`.  Contradiction.

The criterion's own proof carries this through `hKpos : ∀ y ∈ K, Positive y` with
`K = closure Zupper ∩ {…}`, which is the same step packaged.  We reproduce only the part
needed for the contradiction; neither the entropy level nor compactness is needed, because
steps 1–3 already give `∀ s, ε ≤ wmax s`.

## The general mechanism

`positive_omegaLimit_of_confinedToFlooredRegion` isolates the whole mechanism with **no**
reaction-network structure: mass-action field, complex balancedness, relative-entropy level,
compactness and orbit-compactness all absent.  The conclusion is forced by topology alone.
That is why it cannot be evaded by refining the CRNT-specific parts of the criterion — and it
is the same shape as the `Permanent`-based obstruction: a compact positive confining set
absorbs the orbit closure, ω lies in it, and hence *every* ω-point is positive.

## Consequence for route selection

`exists_positive_omegaPoint_of_upperRegion` is **not** the endgame for this hole.  It is a
correct theorem about a situation that cannot arise here.  Every packaged criterion whose
`hsep` is a coordinate floor is refuted by the same mechanism.

This is a statement about the *routes*, not about the hole's truth: the hole's own hypotheses
remain consistent and are not assumed here.  What this does **not** decide is whether the hole
is provable by some other route.  For that, see `docs/hole-reachability.md`, whose
"Available-but-unused capabilities" section lists — computed, not curated — the proved,
hole-free modules that already sit in each hole's import closure and are never used.

Depends on: `CRNT.Dynamics.HighCodimensionSiphonFace` (for `orbit_stays_in_upperRegion`),
`CRNT.Dynamics.EndotacticPermanence` (for `omegaLimit_subset_closure_image2`).

/-- **Adjudication: the upper-region criterion's `hfloor` is unsatisfiable whenever the
ω-limit set has a non-positive point.**

Take exactly the hypotheses of `exists_positive_omegaPoint_of_upperRegion`
(`CRNT/Dynamics/HighCodimensionSiphonFace.lean:1596`) — in particular `hfloor`, the floor on
the upper region — together with three ω-limit hypotheses: `wmax ∈ ω`, `Pmax` nonempty, and
`∀ s, s ∈ Pmax ↔ wmax s = 0`.  Those are `hwmax`, `hPmaxne`, `hzeroMax` at the hole
`CRNT/Dynamics/HighCodimensionSiphonFace.lean:135`.

The proof runs the criterion's own steps and stops as soon as they conflict:

* `hstay`: the whole forward orbit stays in `Zupper`, by `orbit_stays_in_upperRegion` driven by
  non-crossing `hsplit` and the start point `hx₀Z`;
* `hω`: every ω-limit point is in `closure Zupper`, since ω-limit points lie in the closure of
  the orbit image and the orbit image lies in `Zupper`;
* `hfloorC`: `hfloor` survives passage to the closure, so `∀ s, ε ≤ wmax s`, and `hε : 0 < ε`
  makes `wmax` strictly positive;
* contradiction with `hzeroMax` at any member of the nonempty `Pmax`.

Consequently no construction of `Zlow`, `Zupper`, `ε`, `hsplit` and `hfloor` can be supplied
from the hole's hypotheses: that system of hypotheses is already contradictory. -/

/-- **The general mechanism, with no reaction-network structure at all.**

If the forward orbit of `x₀` under `ϕ` stays inside a set `Zupper` carrying a uniform positive
floor `ε` on every coordinate, then *every* ω-limit point is strictly positive.

No mass-action field, no complex balancedness, no relative-entropy level, no compactness and
no orbit-compactness hypothesis appears.  That is the point: the conclusion is forced by
topology alone, which is why it cannot be evaded by refining any of the CRNT-specific parts
of `exists_positive_omegaPoint_of_upperRegion`.  The mechanism is the same one that makes
`Permanent` (`CRNT/Dynamics/EndotacticPermanence.lean:58`) so strong: a positive confining set
absorbs the orbit closure, ω lies in it, so every ω-point is positive. -/
