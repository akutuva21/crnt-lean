# Relative-entropy descent for orbits positive on the open forward ray

`relEntropy_antitone_along_solution` proves Lyapunov descent of `t ↦ relEntropy x* (γ t)`
along a mass-action solution that is **strictly positive at every time**, because the chain
rule `relEntropy_hasDerivAt` is available only in the open orthant. That positivity-everywhere
hypothesis is stronger than the descent conclusion needs: the derivative is only used on the
*interior* of the time interval, while the endpoint contributes through continuity alone, and
`relEntropy` is continuous on the whole closed orthant (`relEntropy_continuous`).

This module relaxes the time-zero positivity. It proves descent for an orbit that is positive
only on the **open** ray `(0, ∞)`, allowing the orbit to sit on the boundary at `t = 0`:

```
relEntropy x* (γ t) ≤ relEntropy x* (γ 0)   for all t ≥ 0,
```

obtained by `antitoneOn_of_deriv_nonpos` on each `Icc 0 b`, taking continuity at the endpoint
from `relEntropy_continuous` and the nonpositive derivative on the open interval from
`relEntropy_hasDerivAt` + `dissipation_nonpos`. Feeding the resulting bound into
`siphonFace_forwardInvariant_of_relEntropy_le` yields a siphon-face invariance theorem whose
positivity hypothesis is weakened from positive-everywhere to positive-on-`(0,∞)`.

## Scope

This does **not** cover a genuinely face-confined orbit (one that vanishes on the siphon `P`,
hence is not positive, at *all* times including positive `t`). Along such an orbit `relEntropy`
is never differentiable, so no descent follows from the chain rule; establishing descent there
would need a boundary dissipation certificate or an interior-approximation/continuous-dependence
argument (solutions through nearby interior points), neither of which is available here. The
relaxation delivered is exactly: the orbit may touch the boundary at the initial instant `t = 0`
but must be interior thereafter. A single theorem subsuming both the positive and the
face-confined regimes with no positivity input remains a strictly larger, open gap (full
Anderson persistence — interior orbits repelled from critical-siphon faces — needs Farkas/LP
feasibility and ω-limit theory absent from the library).

## Main results

* `Network.relEntropy_antitone_along_solution_of_pos_pos`: Lyapunov descent for an orbit
  positive on the open ray `(0, ∞)`.
* `Network.relEntropy_le_zero_along_solution_of_pos_pos`: the sublevel bound
  `relEntropy x* (γ t) ≤ relEntropy x* (γ 0)` for `t ≥ 0`, the form consumed downstream.
* `Network.siphonFace_forwardInvariant_of_complexBalanced_pos_pos`: siphon-face forward
  invariance for a complex-balanced-referenced orbit positive on `(0, ∞)`, with neither a box
  hypothesis, a relative-entropy bound, nor positivity at `t = 0` assumed.

Depends on: `CRNT.Dynamics.ConfinedInvariance`.

/-- **Lyapunov descent under open-ray positivity.** Relative to a positive complex-balanced
reference `x*`, the relative entropy is antitone on `[0, ∞)` along a mass-action solution that
is strictly positive for every `t > 0` — positivity at `t = 0` is *not* required.

The derivative `d/dt relEntropy x* (γ t) = ∑_s (log γ_s − log x*_s)·γ'_s` is taken only on the
interior `(0, b)` of each `Icc 0 b`, where positivity holds, and is nonpositive by
`dissipation_nonpos`; continuity at the left endpoint `0` (the one boundary instant) comes from
`relEntropy_continuous`. So `antitoneOn_of_deriv_nonpos` yields antitonicity on every `Icc 0 b`,
hence on `Ici 0`. -/

a positive complex-balanced reference, the relative entropy never exceeds its initial value:

/-- **Siphon-face invariance for a complex-balanced orbit positive on the open ray.** A genuine
mass-action integral curve `γ` with a positive complex-balanced reference `x*`, starting on
`SiphonFace P` of a siphon `P` and strictly positive for every `t > 0`, stays on `SiphonFace P`
for all forward time — with no box hypothesis, no supplied relative-entropy bound, and *no
positivity assumption at `t = 0`*.

The Lyapunov bound `relEntropy x* (γ t) ≤ relEntropy x* (γ 0)` is supplied by
`relEntropy_le_zero_along_solution_of_pos_pos`, which holds because `x*` is complex-balanced; the
bound discharges the box hypothesis through `siphonFace_forwardInvariant_of_relEntropy_le`. The
nonnegativity input needed by that theorem at `t = 0` comes from `γ 0 ∈ SiphonFace P` being a
boundary point of the closed orthant; at positive times it is the positivity hypothesis. -/
