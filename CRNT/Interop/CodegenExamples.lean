# Generated-certificate example

This module mirrors the shape of a Lean file that an external tool (a CRN compiler,
SBML/SBOL exporter, or AI design system) would emit: it declares a species type, the
complexes, an indexed reaction type, the network, and then *checks* structural
properties. Reachability claims are discharged with the verified walk checker
`reaches_of_walk`, whose `Bool` side closes by `decide` on the concrete network.

See `docs/generated-certificates.md` for the emission contract.

This module is **stable** (example/test). It contains no `sorry`.
