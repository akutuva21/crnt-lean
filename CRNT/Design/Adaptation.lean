# Perfect adaptation via antithetic integral feedback

The antithetic integral feedback (AIF) motif of Briat, Gupta, and Khammash realises
perfect adaptation: at any steady state the sensed output is pinned to a setpoint that
depends only on the controller reference and sensing rates, independent of every other
rate constant.

The motif is modelled as a concrete `Network` over three species — two controller
species `Z1`, `Z2` and the output `X` — with three reactions:

```text
ref:   0 → Z1            (constant reference production at rate κ.ref)
sense: X → X + Z2        (output catalytically produces the sensing species Z2)
seq:   Z1 + Z2 → 0       (mutual sequestration)
```

The actuation reaction `Z1 → Z1 + X` linking the controller to the plant is omitted:
the setpoint property is a balance condition on the controller species `Z1` and `Z2`
alone, so the motif is a drop-in controller agnostic to the plant producing or
consuming `X`. At steady state the two controller production rates are equal,
`κ.sense * x_X = κ.ref`, which fixes the output `x_X = κ.ref / κ.sense`.

This module is **stable**. Depends on: `CRNT.Kinetics.MassAction`,
`CRNT.Equilibria.SteadyState`.
