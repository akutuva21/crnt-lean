# The zero-separating-surface construction interface

A *zero-separating surface* is a `C¹` function `g : E → ℝ` whose sublevel set `{g ≤ c}` is
forward-invariant for a toric differential inclusion and is separated from a ball about the
origin, so a genuine flow starting in it stays a fixed distance from extinction. Such a surface
is the geometric heart of the persistence argument in Craciun, _Toric differential inclusions
and a proof of the global attractor conjecture_.

`ThmBGenuine.lean` proves the *consequence*: if a function `g` admits neighborhood-descent of the
field on a band around a sublevel value `c`, and the sublevel set `{g ≤ c}` is separated from a
ball about the origin, then the genuine flow stays in `{g ≤ c}` and a fixed distance from `0`.
The remaining task is to *construct* such a `g` out of a toric differential inclusion, by
induction on dimension. This module packages the surface as a predicate and wires it to
`ThmBGenuine`, proves the one-dimensional base case, and states the induction step
precisely. The simplicial gluing that would discharge the induction step is taken as a hypothesis,
not constructed here.

## What this module formalizes

* `ZeroSeparatingSurfaceExists f x₀`: the **surface-existence predicate.** For a genuine vector
  field `f : E → E` (intended to be a selection of a toric inclusion field) and a start `x₀`,
  there exist `g : E → ℝ`, a derivative field `g'`, and reals `c δ r` such that the full
  hypothesis bundle of `ThmBGenuine.genuine_away_from_origin` holds: `g` is `C¹`, has
  neighborhood descent `g' y (f y) ≤ 0` on the band `{c − δ ≤ g y ≤ c + δ}` (`δ > 0`),
  `g x₀ ≤ c`, and `{g ≤ c}` misses `Metric.ball 0 r` (`r > 0`).

* `ZeroSeparatingSurfaceExists.away_from_origin` — the **wiring lemma.** From the surface
  existence and any genuine curve `γ` with `γ 0 = x₀` solving `ẋ = f (γ t)` on `[0, ∞)`, the
  genuine trajectory keeps a hard distance `r` from the origin for all forward times. A direct
  feed into `genuine_away_from_origin`. `genuineZeroSeparating` repackages it as a
  `GenuineZeroSeparating` bundle.

* `toricSelection_zeroSeparating` — the **toric wrapper.** Same conclusion stated against a fan
  `F` and scale `δfan`, given a witness that the genuine field `f` is a pointwise selection of
  `toricInclusionField F δfan` together with the surface existence for `f`.

* `zeroSeparatingSurfaceExists_one_dim` — the **1-D base case**. When the genuine
  field on `ℝ` is nonnegative near and beyond a far point (`f y ≥ 0` for `y ≥ P₀ − 1`, say via the
  toric inclusion being `⊆ Ici 0` there) the affine surface `g := fun x => P₀ − x` separates: the
  sublevel set `{g ≤ 0} = {x ≥ P₀}` is the far ray, descent is `g' · f = −f ≤ 0`, and the ray
  misses `Metric.ball 0 P₀`. This realizes `ZeroSeparatingSurfaceExists` in dimension one and
  connects to `ZeroSeparating.zeroSeparatingRegion_Ici`.

* `InductionStepHypothesis` — the **induction-step interface**, stated as a precise `Prop`
  shape "a faithful `(n−1)`-D zero-separating surface yields an `n`-D one", with the simplicial
  construction itself taken as a hypothesis, *not* proved.

## What is proved here, and what is taken as a hypothesis

Proved here:

* the surface-existence predicate and its wiring to `genuine_away_from_origin`;
* the 1-D base case realizing the predicate.

Taken as hypotheses, not constructed here — the geometric core of the surface construction:

* **Neighborhood patches.** Cover a neighborhood of `0` in the positive orthant by the
  cones of the fan; on each cone the toric field is the polar cone, giving a constant admissible
  half-space. The separating surface is assembled patch-by-patch.
* **2-D polygonal zero-separating curves.** In the plane, the surface is a polygonal line
  whose edges are subtangent to the field on each patch; the induction base above dimension one.
* **The naive `n`-D surface and its failure in `ℝ⁴`.** The direct generalization of the
  3-D dotted-surface construction is *overdetermined* in `ℝ⁴`: the per-patch subtangency
  constraints exceed the available degrees of freedom. This is the subtlety that forces the
  inductive simplicial approach instead of a closed-form surface.
* **The simplicial induction.** A faithful `(n−1)`-D zero-separating surface on each facet
  of a simplicial subdivision is glued into an `n`-D one. `InductionStepHypothesis` states the
  shape of this step; the gluing, the subdivision combinatorics, and the verification that the
  glued surface retains neighborhood-descent are taken as given.

These rest additionally on the set-valued viability (Nagumo) layer absent from Mathlib,
recorded in `ZeroSeparating.lean`; the genuine-flow wiring here needs only the single-valued
descent lemma, which is why the predicate and base case land cleanly.

/-- **Zero-separating-surface existence.** For a genuine vector
field `f : E → E` and a start `x₀`: there is a `C¹` function `g`, a derivative field `g'`, a
sublevel value `c`, a band radius `δ > 0`, and a separation margin `r > 0` such that

* `g` is continuous and `HasFDerivAt g (g' y) y` everywhere (so `g` is `C¹` with field `g'`);
* neighborhood descent holds: `g' y (f y) ≤ 0` whenever `c − δ ≤ g y ≤ c + δ`;
* the start lies in the sublevel set: `g x₀ ≤ c`;
* the sublevel set is separated from the origin: `{g ≤ c} ⊆ (Metric.ball 0 r)ᶜ`.

This is exactly the hypothesis bundle that `genuine_away_from_origin` consumes, so an instance of
this predicate is precisely a separating surface for the field. -/

keeps a hard distance from the origin: there is `r > 0` with `r ≤ dist (γ t) 0` for all `t ≥ 0`.
The origin is therefore not an `ω`-limit point of `γ`. This feeds the surface directly into
`genuine_away_from_origin`. -/

/-! ## Item 1 (continued) — the toric wrapper

The genuine mass-action flow is a *selection* of the toric differential inclusion
(`toricInclusionField`): its velocity `f x` is an admissible velocity `f x ∈ F_{F,δfan}(log x)`.
A zero-separating surface separates that genuine selection, so the persistence conclusion holds
for the genuine flow whenever a separating surface for `f` exists. -/

zero-separating surface for `f` at `x₀` exists (`ZeroSeparatingSurfaceExists f x₀`). Then
every genuine trajectory `γ` of `f` through `x₀` keeps a hard positive distance from the origin
for all forward times. The selection hypothesis records that `γ` is also an inclusion solution of
the toric field, the form persistence is stated against in the inclusion layer. -/

/-! ## Item 2 — the 1-D base case

In one dimension, near and beyond the far point `P₀` the toric inclusion is exactly `dx/dt ≥ 0`:
the admissible velocities form the nonnegative ray. The genuine field `f` is then a selection
with `f y ≥ 0` on the sublevel band. The affine surface `g := fun x => P₀ − x` has constant
derivative field `g' y = -(ContinuousLinearMap.id …)` evaluated as `g' y v = -v`, so descent is
`g' y (f y) = -(f y) ≤ 0`. The sublevel set `{g ≤ 0} = {x ≥ P₀} = Set.Ici P₀` is the far ray,
which misses `Metric.ball 0 P₀`. This realizes `ZeroSeparatingSurfaceExists`. -/

/-! ## Item 3 — the induction-step interface

The induction turns a faithful zero-separating surface on the boundary facets of a
simplicial subdivision (the `(n−1)`-D data) into a zero-separating surface on the full `n`-D
neighborhood. Below is the *shape* of that step as a `Prop`: it asserts that surface existence on
each facet-restricted field implies surface existence on the ambient field. The hypothesis
quantifies the facet data abstractly — a finite family of `(n−1)`-D restricted fields and start
points each carrying its own surface — and the conclusion is ambient surface existence. The
content of the step — the simplicial subdivision combinatorics, the polygonal-lines-of-patches
gluing, and the verification that the glued surface retains neighborhood-descent across facet
seams (delicate, since the naive closed form fails in `ℝ⁴`) — is taken as a hypothesis and is
**not** proved here. -/
