# Fan refinement and faithful transfer to a coarser fan

A ruled patch aligned simultaneously to several attracting directions has no surface normal once
those directions span the ambient space, which first occurs in dimension four
(`ZeroSeparatingInduction.over_determined_in_dim_four`). Craciun's faithful blueprint controls which
fan cones constrain a normal at each smooth point. This module proves that admissibility transfers
from a supplied fine cell to a containing coarse cell, and that an explicitly supplied constraint
family of cardinality below `finrank` admits a nonzero orthogonal normal. It does not construct the
blueprint subdivision or prove that its local patches satisfy that cardinality bound.

This module provides the transfer and finite-refinement engines:

* the **faithful-transfer engine** — admissibility for a finer cell transfers to the containing coarse
  cell, so the finer surface's normals are admissible for the coarse fan; and

* the **finite common-refinement engine** — a finite list of supplied fans can be intersected
  successively, preserving the fan axioms and dual finite generation of every cell; and

* the **projection coverage step** — images of a complete fan cover the target of a surjective
  linear map, and images of finitely generated cells are exact finitely generated cones;

* the **one-dimensional projection step** — a finite half-space description remains finite under
  projection when each fiber is a translate of a single kernel direction and a linear section is
  supplied;

* the **conditional feasibility lemma** — a supplied patch with fewer than `finrank ℝ E` active
  attracting directions admits a valid surface normal.

* the **central-arrangement fan engine** — the family of all weak sign/equality cells for a finite
  set of hyperplane normals is a complete polyhedral fan, with exposed-face closure from finite
  Farkas decomposition; and

* the **conditional arrangement-refinement engine** — for any supplied covering polyhedral fan
  whose cells have finite dual representations, the arrangement of the union of those normals
  refines the fan;

## Contents

* `Refines F' F` — the refinement relation: every cell of `F'` is contained (as a set) in some cell
  of `F`.

* `attractsToward_coarse_of_fine` — a normal admissible for a finer cell `C' ⊆ C` is admissible for
  the coarse cell `C` (`Faithful.AttractsToward` is monotone under cell containment).

* `coneDual_coarse_subset_halfPlane_of_fine_mem` — consequently the coarse cell's toric-field polar
  `coneDual C` lies in the normal's region-side half-plane `{y | 0 ≤ ⟪n, y⟫_ℝ}`: a fine-admissible
  normal makes the coarse field inward.

* `exists_coarse_cell_of_refines` — packaged over `Refines`: a normal admissible for a cell of the
  refinement is admissible for some cell of the coarse fan.

* `exists_patch_normal_of_card_lt_finrank` — an explicitly indexed patch with fewer than
  `finrank ℝ E` attracting-direction constraints admits a nonzero orthogonal surface normal.


## Scope

This module proves the refinement relation, the faithful-transfer of admissibility (and of field
inwardness) from fine to coarse cells, finite common-refinement closure for supplied polyhedral fans
with dual-finitely-generated cells, and coverage of the closed-cone image family under a surjective
linear map. It also proves that split projections with a one-dimensional kernel preserve finite
dual representations, that a finite central hyperplane arrangement gives a polyhedral fan covering
the ambient space, and that its arrangement refines any supplied covering cone family with
dual-finitely-generated cells. In particular, the arrangement refines the projected image family of
a complete polyhedral fan under such a projection, yielding a complete polyhedral fan refinement
with dual-finitely-generated cells; this does not establish that the image family itself is a fan. The
faithful blueprint, its patch decomposition, and the analysis matching per-patch attracting
directions remain separate constructions.

Depends on: `CRNT.Geometry.ZeroSeparatingInduction`,
`CRNT.Geometry.FaithfulCurve`.
