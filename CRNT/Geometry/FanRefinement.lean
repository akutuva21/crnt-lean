# Fan refinement and faithful transfer to a coarser fan

A ruled patch aligned simultaneously to several attracting directions has no surface normal once
those directions span the ambient space, which first occurs in dimension four
(`ZeroSeparatingInduction.over_determined_in_dim_four`). This over-determination is avoided by
*refining the fan*: subdivide each cell into finer cells, build the zero-separating surface for the
finer inclusion, and observe that for each coarse cell the surface's normals (away from the coarse
uncertainty regions) land in the coarse cell's attracting cone — so the finer surface is **faithful
for the coarse inclusion**. Refinement breaks each over-constrained patch into a sequence of patches
each crossing a single uncertainty region, keeping the per-patch constraint count below `finrank`
(the planar angular chaining, lifted to `n` dimensions).

This module provides the two engines of that transfer:

* the **faithful-transfer engine** — admissibility for a finer cell transfers to the containing coarse
  cell, so the finer surface's normals are admissible for the coarse fan; and

* the **feasibility restoration** — a refined patch carrying fewer than `finrank ℝ E` active
  attracting directions always admits a valid surface normal.

## Contents

* `Refines F' F` — the refinement relation: every cell of `F'` is contained (as a set) in some cell
  of `F`.

* `attractsToward_coarse_of_fine` — a normal admissible for a finer cell `C' ⊆ C` is admissible for
  the coarse cell `C` (`Faithful.AttractsToward` is monotone under cell containment).

* `coneDual_coarse_subset_halfPlane_of_fine_mem` — consequently the coarse cell's toric-field polar
  `coneDual C` lies in the normal's region-side half-plane `{y | 0 ≤ ⟪n, y⟫_ℝ}`: a fine-admissible
  normal makes the coarse field inward.

* `exists_coarse_cell_of_refines` — packaged over `Refines`: a normal admissible for a cell of the
  refinement is admissible for some cell of the coarse fan.

* `refined_patch_normal_exists` — a refined patch with fewer than `finrank ℝ E` attracting-direction
  constraints admits a nonzero orthogonal surface normal: refinement keeps each patch below the
  over-determination threshold.

## Scope

This module proves the refinement relation, the faithful-transfer of admissibility (and of field
inwardness) from fine to coarse cells, and the feasibility restoration. Not constructed here: the
explicit decomposition that produces the refined fan with each patch crossing a single uncertainty
region, and the analysis matching the per-patch attracting directions — the constructions these
engines consume.

This module is **stable** and `sorry`-free. Depends on: `CRNT.Geometry.ZeroSeparatingInduction`,
`CRNT.Geometry.FaithfulCurve`.

/-- **The refinement relation.** `F'` refines `F` when every cell of `F'` is contained, as a set, in
some cell of `F`: each coarse cell is subdivided into finer cells, so the finer fan resolves the
coarse one. -/

/-- **Admissibility transfers from fine to coarse.** If a finer cell `C'` is contained in a coarse
cell `C` and the normal `n` attracts toward `C'` (`n ∈ C'`), then `n` attracts toward `C`: the
attracting-direction condition is monotone under cell containment. This is why a surface faithful for
the refined fan is faithful for the coarse fan — its normals, admissible for the finer cells, are
admissible for the containing coarse cells. -/

`C'` contained in the coarse cell `C`, then the coarse cell's toric-field polar `coneDual C` lies in

field point into the region — the support side of faithfulness transferred from fine to coarse. -/

/-- **Feasibility restoration by refinement.** A refined patch crossing fewer than `finrank ℝ E`
uncertainty regions carries fewer than `finrank ℝ E` attracting-direction constraints, so a nonzero
surface normal orthogonal to all of them exists. Refinement keeps every patch below this threshold —
each patch crossing a single uncertainty region — which is how it avoids the over-determination of
`over_determined_in_dim_four`. -/
