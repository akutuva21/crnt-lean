# Indexed directed paths in a relation

`CRNT.relationGraphOn` forgets the orientation of the causal relation, and `SimpleGraph.Walk`
offers only vertex-indexed cuts (`takeUntil` / `dropUntil`), which are the wrong shape for
arguments that need to cut a walk at a *position*. This file gives a directed walk as an
explicitly indexed structure, where cutting a tail and splicing out a repeat are both plain
reindexings.

The purpose is the orientation-sensitive half of the true-SR endgame: a c-pair of a
species-reaction path agrees with a sign change of `σ` exactly at reaction vertices whose two
incident causal edges point *oppositely*, which for a path means the path is directed. So the
escape argument there needs a directed path, not merely a walk in the underlying graph.

`exists_minimal_relPath` is the payoff: among the directed paths from a distinguished set to a
fixed target, a shortest one is injective and meets the distinguished set only at its start.
