# Separations, nonseparability, and end blocks of a finite graph

Shinar--Feinberg, *Concordant Chemical Reaction Networks and the Species-Reaction Graph*
(arXiv:1203.6560), §5.5, draws on standard finite-graph vocabulary (Bondy--Murty, Graph
Theory, ch. 10) to decompose a source of the sign-causality graph into **source-blocks**:

* a *separation* of a connected graph splits it into two connected pieces meeting in
  exactly one vertex, the *separating vertex*;
* a *block* is a maximal nonseparable subgraph (nonseparable = connected, no separating
  vertex);
* an *end block* is a block containing at most one separating vertex of the original
  graph — equivalently, a leaf of the block-tree;
* because a source is strongly connected, each of its blocks is strongly connected and
  nonseparable, and the classification (Proposition 5.8) says each block is an S-block,
  an R-block, or a single cycle.

This file supplies the first layer of that vocabulary.  Everything is phrased for an
ambient relation `E` restricted to a vertex set: walks are `relationGraph E`-walks whose
vertices stay inside the set, matching how the repository's `RelPath E T` records paths
of a source.  The separating-vertex definition uses the path-blocking description
("every `a`–`b` walk inside the set passes through `v`"), the vertex-removal form of the
paper's edge-form separation.

**Deferred (per the session verdict on the block datum):** maximality of blocks, the
existence of the block decomposition and its block-tree (including the leaf fact used by
§5.9 leaf removal), and directed ear decomposition existence (§A.1, Proposition A.3) are
*not* in Mathlib and are not developed here.  The repository's
`DirectedEar`/`DirectedEarDecomposition` scaffolding (TrueChemistrySRCriterion.lean)
covers only the ear side and records the same gap in its docstring.

`S`, but only through `v`. -/

/-- `v` is a separating vertex of the graph induced by `S`: some two vertices of `S`
other than `v` are connected inside `S`, but every such walk passes through `v`
(Shinar--Feinberg §5.5). -/

`E`-walk staying inside `S`. -/

(Shinar--Feinberg §5.5 after Bondy--Murty). -/

  ConnectedOn E S ∧ ∀ v ∈ S, ¬ IsSeparatingVertexOn E S v

/-- An end block of the ambient graph on `T`: the induced graph on `S` is nonseparable
and `S` contains at most one separating vertex of the *ambient* graph — the defining
property of a leaf of the block-tree (§5.5).  Maximality of `S` as a block is deferred
with the block-existence theory (see the module docstring). -/

/-- Sanity: if the ambient vertex set has at most two vertices, no vertex separates any
pair inside it — the witnesses would be two elements of a set of at most one element. -/
